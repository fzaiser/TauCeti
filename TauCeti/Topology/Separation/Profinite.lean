# Continuous extension from a closed subspace of a profinite space

Let `X` be a profinite space — compact, Hausdorff and totally disconnected — and let `Y` be a
discrete space. This file proves that a continuous map into `Y` defined on a *closed* subspace
`s ⊆ X` extends to a continuous map on all of `X`, as soon as one of `s` and `Y` is nonempty;
equivalently, that restriction `C(X, Y) → C(s, Y)` is surjective for every closed `s ⊆ X` when
`Y` is nonempty.

This is the zero-dimensional analogue of the Tietze extension theorem. Nothing can be averaged
here, since `Y` is a bare discrete space; instead the map has only finitely many fibres, because a
compact subset of a discrete space is finite, and those fibres are separated by a clopen
partition of `X`. Mathlib's `Profinite.exists_lift_of_finite_of_injective_of_surjective` packages
that separation as a lifting property — this is where total disconnectedness is used — and the
work below is the passage from a lifting square to an extension.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_continuous_eqOn_range_subset_image`: for a nonempty closed `s`, a map
  continuous on `s` extends to a continuous map on `X` whose range is still contained in the
  image of `s`.
* `TauCeti.exists_continuous_eqOn`: an ambient function continuous on an arbitrary closed `s`
  agrees there with a continuous function on `X`, without a nonemptiness assumption.
* `ContinuousMap.exists_restrict_eq_of_discrete` and
  `ContinuousMap.restrict_surjective_of_discrete`: the bundled form, for a closed set.
* `ContinuousMap.exists_extension_of_discrete`: the bundled form, for a closed embedding.

## Implementation notes

The statements come both for a bare function together with `ContinuousOn` and for bundled
`ContinuousMap`s. The unbundled form is the one continuous cochains are written in, and the bundled
form mirrors Mathlib's Tietze API; it lives in the root `ContinuousMap` namespace, so that dot
notation on a `C(s, Y)` reaches it, and carries an `_of_discrete` suffix to distinguish it from
Mathlib's `TietzeExtension` form of the same statement.

The bundled forms need a nonemptiness hypothesis. If `s` is empty and `Y` is empty while `X` is not,
there is a continuous map on `s` and none on `X`, so one of `s` and `Y` has to be assumed nonempty.
In the unbundled form, the ambient function `f : X → Y` already rules out this obstruction.

Total disconnectedness of `X` is not decoration either. On the compact Hausdorff space
`[0, 1] ⊆ ℝ` no map into a discrete space separates the two points of the closed subspace
`{0, 1}`, so a map taking two distinct values there has no continuous extension; this is spelled
out as an example in `TauCeti/Topology/LocallyConstant/Preconnected.lean`, where the
preconnectedness that drives it lives. Discreteness of `Y` is what makes the fibres clopen, and it
is likewise essential.

/-- **Continuous extension from a closed subspace of a profinite space.** A map continuous on a
nonempty closed subset `s` of a profinite space, with values in a discrete space, extends to a
continuous map on the whole space, and the extension can be chosen to take no value that is not
already taken on `s`.

That last clause is what lets a consumer keep the extension inside a subgroup, a submodule, or any
other set the original values lie in. -/

These live in the root `ContinuousMap` namespace, next to Mathlib's Tietze extension theorems and
within reach of dot notation on a `C(s, Y)`. -/
