# Locally constant functions on a compact group are uniformly locally constant

A locally constant function `f : G → A` on a topological group is constant near each point, but
the neighbourhood on which it is constant depends on the point. On a *compact* group the
dependence disappears: there is a single open subgroup `V` with `f (x * v) = f x` for **every**
`x : G` and every `v : V`. This file records that subgroup,
`TauCeti.rightTranslationStabilizer f`, and its openness,
`TauCeti.isOpen_rightTranslationStabilizer`.

The proof is the tube lemma. The set of pairs `(x, g)` with `f (x * g) = f x` is open, because it
is the locus where two locally constant functions of `(x, g)` agree, and it contains `G × {1}`;
compactness of `G` produces a single open `V ∋ 1` that works for every `x` at once. Being a
subgroup that is a neighbourhood of `1`, the stabilizer is then open.

Compactness is the hypothesis the tube lemma consumes, and it is what turns "for each `x` there
is a neighbourhood of `1`" into "there is a neighbourhood of `1` that works for every `x`". Nothing
weaker is claimed here: for a non-compact `G` the argument produces a neighbourhood depending on
`x` and no uniform one, and no statement below asserts anything in that case.

Uniform local constancy is what makes the coinduced module of locally constant equivariant maps a
*discrete* `G`-module, its right-translation stabilizers being open.

`TauCeti.exists_isOpen_forall_mul_right_eq` is the form in which a cochain construction consumes
the stabilizer: a continuous family `σ : P → G` of right translations moves `f` only locally in
the parameter `p`, uniformly in the point being translated.

/-- **Uniform local constancy in a parameter.** For a locally constant `f` on a compact group and
a continuous family `σ : P → G` of right translations, every parameter has a neighbourhood on
which `x ↦ f (x * σ p)` does not change at all: the neighbourhood is uniform in `x`. This is the
form in which a cochain built by right-translating a locally constant function is proved locally
constant in its group arguments. -/
