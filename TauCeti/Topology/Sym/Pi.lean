# The subspace of unordered tuples with one point in each member of a family

`TauCeti.Sym.pi A` is the set of unordered `n`-tuples having one point in each member of a family
`A : Fin n → Set α` of subsets. This file gives it its topology, as a subspace of the symmetric
power `Sym α n`: it is closed when the members of the family are, compact when they are, and, for a
pairwise disjoint family of compact sets in a Hausdorff space, homeomorphic to the product
`∀ i, ↥(A i)` of its members.

The case to keep in mind is the torus `T_α = α₁ × ⋯ × α_g ⊆ Sym^g(Σ)` attached to the `g`
pairwise disjoint attaching circles of a Heegaard diagram on a surface `Σ` (Ozsváth--Szabó,
*Holomorphic disks and topological invariants for closed three-manifolds*, §2.1). The circles are
compact and pairwise disjoint, so `T_α` really is an embedded `g`-torus and not merely a continuous
image of one. The companion open-range statement, where the members of the family are open rather
than compact and the product is an open subspace, is
`TauCeti.Sym.isOpenEmbedding_ofFn_map`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Sym.isClosed_pi` and `TauCeti.Sym.isCompact_pi`: the subspace is closed, respectively
  compact, when the members of the family are.
* `TauCeti.Sym.isClosedEmbedding_ofFn_subtypeVal`: for a pairwise disjoint family of compact sets
  in a Hausdorff space, the parametrization by ordered tuples is a closed embedding.
* `TauCeti.Sym.piHomeomorph`: the resulting homeomorphism with the product of the members.
