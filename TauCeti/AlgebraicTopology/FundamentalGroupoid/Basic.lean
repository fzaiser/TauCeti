# Basic results on fundamental groupoids

This file records basic facts about fundamental groupoids used when comparing the fundamental
groupoid of a space with those of its subspaces: the functor induced by an injective continuous
map is injective on objects (as `CategoryTheory.Subgroupoid.im` requires), and membership of a
path class in a subgroupoid is unchanged by transporting its endpoints along equalities.

## Main declarations

* `ContinuousMap.fundamentalGroupoid_map_obj_injective`: an injective continuous map
  induces a functor of fundamental groupoids that is injective on objects.
* `Path.Homotopic.Quotient.cast_mem_arrows_iff`: membership of a path class in a
  subgroupoid of the fundamental groupoid is unchanged by casting its endpoints along equalities.
