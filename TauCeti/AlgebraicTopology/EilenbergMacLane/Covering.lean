# Asphericity and covering spaces

A covering map `p : E → X` is an isomorphism on homotopy groups in every dimension at least
two, so the higher homotopy of a cover and of its base are the same. Asphericity is therefore
inherited in both directions along a covering map, the only extra input being
path-connectedness of whichever space is not already known to be path-connected.

This file records that transfer and the two `K(G, 1)` recognition principles it yields.

* Downwards: the base of a *surjective* covering map with aspherical total space is aspherical.
  Combined with the identification of the fundamental group of the base of a simply connected
  quotient covering map, a group acting freely and properly discontinuously on a simply
  connected space whose higher homotopy vanishes has an orbit space of type `K(G, 1)`.
  This is the standard way `K(G, 1)` spaces are produced.
* Upwards: a path-connected covering space of an aspherical space is aspherical. Its
  fundamental group is the subgroup of `π₁` of the base recovered by `p`, because a covering
  map is injective on fundamental groups, so a path-connected cover of a `K(G, 1)` is a
  `K(H, 1)` for that subgroup `H`.

Taking the total space simply connected in the upwards direction says that the universal cover
of an aspherical space is weakly contractible: all of its homotopy groups vanish, including
`π₁`, which is where simple connectedness enters. Nothing here asserts that such a cover is
contractible; that is a genuinely stronger statement, requiring a Whitehead-type theorem which
this development does not have.

The `ᵐᵒᵖ` in Mathlib's `IsQuotientCoveringMap.fundamentalGroupEquiv` is invisible in the
`K(G, 1)` statement below: being a `K(G, 1)` is invariant under `MulEquiv.inv'`, the
isomorphism `G ≃* Gᵐᵒᵖ` sending `g` to `op g⁻¹`.

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/UniversalCovers/README.md`, Stage 4, item 13, "`K(G, 1)`
spaces", by supplying the covering-space recognition principle for them; the concrete circle
and torus examples were proved directly.

## Main declarations

* `IsCoveringMap.subsingleton_homotopyGroup_iff`: a cover and its base have the same
  higher homotopy groups.
* `IsCoveringMap.isAspherical`: **the base of a surjective covering map with aspherical
  total space is aspherical**.
* `IsCoveringMap.isAspherical_totalSpace`: **a path-connected covering space of an
  aspherical space is aspherical**.
* `IsCoveringMap.subsingleton_homotopyGroup_of_isAspherical`: **the simply connected
  cover of an aspherical space is weakly contractible**.
* `IsCoveringMap.isEilenbergMacLaneSpaceOne_totalSpace`: a path-connected cover of a
  `K(G, 1)` is a `K(H, 1)` for the subgroup `H` it recovers.
* `IsQuotientCoveringMap.isEilenbergMacLaneSpaceOne`: **the orbit space of a free,
  properly discontinuous action of `G` on a simply connected space with vanishing higher
  homotopy is a `K(G, 1)`**.

The isomorphism on higher homotopy groups is
`IsCoveringMap.homotopyGroupPiMulEquiv`; the injectivity of a covering map on
fundamental groups is `IsCoveringMap.mapOfEq_injective`. The identification of the
fundamental group of the base of a simply connected quotient covering map with the opposite
of the acting group is Junyan Xu's `IsQuotientCoveringMap.fundamentalGroupEquiv` in
`Mathlib/Topology/Homotopy/Lifting.lean`. Compare Proposition 4.1 and Section 1.B of
[hatcher02]; no external formalization is copied or adapted here.
