# Pointed connected covers are determined by the subgroup they recover

A *pointed cover* of `(X, x)` is a covering map `p : E → X` together with a lift `e₀` of `x`.
It recovers the subgroup `p_* π₁(E, e₀) ≤ π₁(X, x)`, and
`IsCoveringMap.stabilizer_eq_range` identifies that subgroup with the stabiliser of `e₀`
for the monodromy action. This file proves that, for path-connected and locally path-connected
total spaces, the recovered subgroup determines the pointed cover:

* there is a map of pointed covers `(E, e₀) → (F, f₀)` over `X` exactly when
  `p_* π₁(E, e₀) ≤ q_* π₁(F, f₀)`, and it is then unique;
* if the two recovered subgroups are *equal*, that map is a homeomorphism over `X`.

This is the faithful-and-full half of the correspondence between pointed connected covers of
`(X, x)` and subgroups of `π₁(X, x)`; the remaining half is the construction, from a subgroup
`H`, of a cover recovering `H`, which is a separate milestone. Nothing here needs `X` itself to
be path-connected, locally path-connected or semilocally simply connected: those hypotheses are
what make the correspondence *onto*, not what makes it injective.

The existence direction is Mathlib's lifting criterion
`IsCoveringMap.existsUnique_continuousMap_lifts_of_range_le`, applied with the total space `E`
as the source; the only work is the basepoint bookkeeping needed to state it symmetrically in
the two covers, since a pointed cover recovers a subgroup of `π₁(X, x)` rather than of
`π₁(X, p e₀)`. The containment direction is elementary functoriality. Turning the two resulting
maps into a homeomorphism uses Mathlib's uniqueness of lifts on a preconnected space,
`IsCoveringMap.eq_of_comp_eq`, and no further covering-space input.

Specialising to simply connected total spaces gives the uniqueness of the universal cover: any
two simply connected covers of `X` are isomorphic over `X`, by a homeomorphism matching chosen
lifts of a basepoint. (Their universal *property* is already Mathlib's
`IsCoveringMap.existsUnique_continuousMap_lifts`, which lifts any map from a simply connected,
locally path-connected space.)

## Main declarations

* `IsCoveringMap.existsUnique_continuousMap_comp_eq_of_range_le`: a unique map of pointed
  covers over `X` exists as soon as the recovered subgroups are nested.
* `IsCoveringMap.exists_continuousMap_comp_eq_iff_range_le`: such a map exists *exactly*
  when the recovered subgroups are nested.
* `IsCoveringMap.exists_homeomorph_comp_eq_of_range_eq` and
  `IsCoveringMap.totalSpaceHomeomorphOfRangeEq`: pointed covers recovering the same
  subgroup are isomorphic over `X` by a homeomorphism matching the chosen lifts.
* `IsCoveringMap.exists_homeomorph_comp_eq_iff_range_eq`: the recovered subgroup is a
  complete invariant of a pointed cover.
* `IsCoveringMap.eq_totalSpaceHomeomorphOfRangeEq`: that homeomorphism is the only map of
  pointed covers over `X`.
* `IsCoveringMap.deckMulEquivOfRangeEq`: consequently their deck transformation groups
  are isomorphic.
* `IsCoveringMap.exists_homeomorph_comp_eq_of_simplyConnectedSpace`: uniqueness of the
  universal cover.

## References

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/UniversalCovers/README.md`, Stage 2, item 8, first bullet: the
correspondence between *pointed* connected covers of `(X, x₀)` and subgroups of `π₁(X, x₀)`. It
consumes the lifting criterion recorded in Stage 2, item 6
(`TauCeti.Topology.Homotopy.Covering`), and the recovered-subgroup API of
`TauCeti.Topology.Homotopy.Monodromy.Basic`. No Mathlib infrastructure is vendored: the lifting
criterion `IsCoveringMap.existsUnique_continuousMap_lifts_of_range_le` is Junyan Xu's, in
`Mathlib.Topology.Homotopy.Lifting`, while the uniqueness of lifts
`IsCoveringMap.eq_of_comp_eq` is Thomas Browning's, in `Mathlib.Topology.Covering.Basic`, where
it is recorded as Proposition 1.34 of [hatcher02].
