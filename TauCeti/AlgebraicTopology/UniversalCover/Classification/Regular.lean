# Regular connected covers and normal subgroups

A pointed connected covering recovers the image of the fundamental group of its total space in
the fundamental group of the base. This file proves the regular-cover criterion: over a
path-connected base, the covering is regular exactly when that recovered subgroup is normal.

The proof combines two existing classification results. Normality says that the recovered
subgroup is independent of the chosen point in a fibre, while pointed-cover classification says
that equality of those subgroups is exactly the existence of a deck transformation carrying one
chosen point to the other. The monodromy transport API then promotes transitivity on the chosen
fibre to regularity on every fibre.

## Main declaration

* `IsCoveringMap.isRegular_iff_normal_range`: a connected covering is regular exactly
  when its recovered subgroup of the fundamental group is normal.

## References

This is the regular-cover criterion in `TauCetiRoadmap/UniversalCovers/README.md`, Stage 2,
item 8: a cover attached to `H` is regular (normal/Galois) exactly when `H` is normal. It uses
Mathlib's covering-space lifting criterion, due to Junyan Xu, through Tau Ceti's pointed-cover
classification; no external proof is copied or adapted here.
