# Unpointed connected covers are determined by a conjugacy class of subgroups

Choosing a point in the fibre of a connected covering map over `x` recovers a subgroup of
`FundamentalGroup X x`. The pointed classification theorem says that two covers with chosen
fibre points are isomorphic over `X` precisely when these subgroups are equal. Without chosen
fibre points, equality is replaced by conjugacy: moving a fibre point by monodromy conjugates
the recovered subgroup, and every fibre point is reached by monodromy.

This file combines those two facts. For path-connected, locally path-connected covering spaces
`E` and `F`, it proves that there is a homeomorphism `E ≃ₜ F` over `X` if and only if the
subgroups recovered from any chosen lifts `e₀` and `f₀` are conjugate in `π₁(X, x)`. The
conjugacy convention is written explicitly as

`range(q, f₀) = range(p, e₀).map (MulAut.conj γ).toMonoidHom`.

The statement does not need connectedness, local connectedness, or semilocal simple
connectedness of the base. Those hypotheses are needed to construct a cover from every
subgroup, not to compare two covers which already exist.

## Main declarations

* `IsCoveringMap.exists_range_eq_map_conj_of_homeomorph_comp_eq`: an isomorphism of
  unpointed covers makes their recovered subgroups conjugate, as soon as `h e₀` and `f₀`
  are joined by a path.
* `IsCoveringMap.exists_homeomorph_comp_eq_of_range_eq_map_conj`: conjugate recovered
  subgroups give an isomorphism of unpointed covers.
* `IsCoveringMap.exists_homeomorph_comp_eq_iff_exists_range_eq_map_conj`: the
  unpointed connected-cover comparison theorem.

## References

This advances `TauCetiRoadmap/UniversalCovers/README.md`, Stage 2, item 8, second bullet:
unpointed connected covers correspond to conjugacy classes of subgroups. It proves the
comparison-up-to-isomorphism half of that correspondence; constructing a cover from every
subgroup is the separate existence milestone in item 7.

The proof reuses `IsCoveringMap.exists_homeomorph_comp_eq_iff_range_eq` for pointed
covers and `IsCoveringMap.exists_range_eq_map_conj` for change of the chosen lift.
The latter is built on Junyan Xu's monodromy API in
`Mathlib.Topology.Homotopy.Lifting`; no external formalization is copied or adapted here.

section

/-- An isomorphism of unpointed covers carries the subgroup recovered from the source
basepoint to a conjugate of the subgroup recovered from the target basepoint, provided
`h e₀` and `f₀` are joined by a path.

The homeomorphism need not carry `e₀` to `f₀`: its image of `e₀` is another point of the
target fibre, and a path from there to `f₀` is what accounts for the conjugation.

Neither cover is assumed connected. Path-connectedness of `F` is one way to supply `hj`,
and is how `IsCoveringMap.exists_homeomorph_comp_eq_iff_exists_range_eq_map_conj` below
discharges it. -/
