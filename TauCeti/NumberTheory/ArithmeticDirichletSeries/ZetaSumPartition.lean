# Partitioning the partial Dirichlet series over a set of primes

Let `K` be a number field. Mathlib's partial Dirichlet series `NumberField.Set.primeIdealZetaSum`
sums `𝔑𝔭 ^ (-s)` over a set of nonzero prime ideals of `𝓞 K`, and this file cuts that sum along a
partition of the primes. The sum is additive along a finite pairwise disjoint union, given
summability on each piece. For a finite set `S` of primes it also compares the sum over the
complement `Sᶜ` with the sum over all primes: deleting `S` never increases the sum, and for
`s ≥ 0` it lowers it by at most the number of primes deleted.

## Main results

* `NumberField.Set.primeIdealZetaSum_biUnion_of_pairwiseDisjoint`: given summability on each
  piece, the sum over a finite pairwise disjoint union is the sum of the sums over the pieces.
* `NumberField.Set.primeIdealZetaSum_compl_le_univ_of_finite`: deleting a finite set of primes
  does not increase the sum.
* `NumberField.Set.primeIdealZetaSum_univ_sub_compl_le_ncard_of_finite`: for `s ≥ 0`, deleting a
  finite set of primes lowers the sum by at most `S.ncard`.

## Implementation notes

`primeIdealZetaSum S s` is a `tsum`, so it takes the value `0` on a family that is not summable.
That junk value is not additive along a partition, which is why the disjoint-union identity
carries a summability hypothesis.

The same junk value, together with `Set.ncard` being `0` on an infinite set, makes finiteness of
`S` essential to the two complement statements rather than a convenience, and both fail without
it. Take `S = {𝔭₀}ᶜ`, which is itself infinite and whose complement `{𝔭₀}` is a single prime. At
`s = 0` every term is `1`, so the sum over all primes diverges and is read as `0` while the sum
over `{𝔭₀}` is `1`: the first bound reads `1 ≤ 0`. At `s = 2` both sums converge while `S.ncard`
is read as `0`, so the second bound reads `(∑' 𝔭, 𝔑𝔭 ^ (-2)) - 𝔑𝔭₀ ^ (-2) ≤ 0`, whose left-hand
side is the positive sum over the primes other than `𝔭₀`.

## References

The corresponding statements for a source-local `primeIdealZetaSum` over `Set (Ideal (𝓞 K))` are
`primeIdealZetaSum_biUnion_of_pairwiseDisjoint`, `primeIdealZetaSum_union_of_disjoint` and
`primeIdealZetaSum_le_of_subset` in `CebotarevDensity/Density.lean` of
[CBirkbeck/chebotarev-density](https://github.com/CBirkbeck/chebotarev-density) (Apache-2.0,
Birkbeck--Brasca) at commit `8575c9df1ae0a61120ab5c964c7911414254bec7`. Those are gated on `1 < s`;
the statements here take the weaker hypotheses that each proof actually uses — summability on the
participating pieces for the disjoint-union identity, finiteness for the two complement bounds.

/-- **The sum is additive along a finite disjoint union.** The sum over a finite pairwise
disjoint union of sets of primes is the sum of the sums over the pieces.

Summability is asked for on each participating piece rather than on all primes at once: a
finite union of summable pieces is summable even at an `s` where the full prime series
diverges, and the identity holds there too. -/
