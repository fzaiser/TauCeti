# Formations and their finite normal layers

Artin and Tate describe a *formation* by a group `G`, a distinguished family of finite-index
subgroups, and a `G`-module `A` each of whose elements is fixed by a sufficiently small member of
the family. In the arithmetic applications the family is the family of open subgroups of a
compact, totally disconnected Galois group and `A` is a discrete continuous module, so this file
uses the topological formulation: a `Formation` is a smooth discrete topological representation
of `G` over `ℤ`, and its `U`-**level** `A^U` is the submodule fixed by an open subgroup `U`.

A **finite normal layer** is a pair of open subgroups `V ≤ U` with `V` normal in `U`. In field
notation it is the layer `K/F` with `U = G_F` and `V = G_K`. Its Galois group `Γ = U ⧸ V` is
finite because `V` is open in the compact group `U`, its coefficient module is the level `A^V`,
and its ground level is `A^U`. The three constructions below are what the cohomology of the layer
is taken of and compared with:

* `rep`, the coefficient module `A^V` carrying the action of `Γ`. The `U`-action on `A^V` is well
  defined because `V` is normal in `U`, and `V` acts on `A^V` trivially, so the action descends to
  `Γ`.
* `groundLevelEquiv`, the identification `(A^V)^Γ = A^U` of the invariants of the coefficient
  module with the ground level. Both sides are read inside `A^V` — the invariants of `Γ` and the
  ground level comapped along `A^V ⊆ A` are the same submodule of `A^V` — so the identification
  does not move an element of the ambient module.
* `norm`, `normSubgroup` and `NormQuotient`: the norm `N_{U/V} : A^V → A^U`, its image, and the
  quotient `A^U / N_{U/V}(A^V)`.

The additive convention is used throughout, as in the abstract theory; a multiplicative group such
as `Kˣ` enters through an `Additive` adapter.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.Formation`: a compact, totally disconnected topological group's
  smooth discrete integral coefficient module.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.Formation.level`: the level `A^U` of an open subgroup.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer`: a finite normal layer `V ◁ U`.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.Gal`, `degree`: the Galois group `U ⧸ V` and its order.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.ofOpenNormal`: the layer `V ◁ ⊤` of an open normal
  subgroup, with `galOfOpenNormalEquiv` identifying its Galois group with `G ⧸ V`.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.rep`: the coefficient module `A^V` of the layer, as a
  representation of `U ⧸ V`.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.H`, `TateH`, `TrivialTateH`: the ordinary and Tate
  cohomology carriers of the layer, in the coefficient module `A^V` and in trivial integral
  coefficients.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.tateHIsoH`: the identification of positive-degree Tate
  cohomology of the layer with its ordinary cohomology.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.norm`, `normSubgroup`, `NormQuotient`, `normQuotientMk`:
  the norm of the layer, its image, the norm quotient and the quotient map onto it.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.Formation.exists_mem_level`: every element of the coefficient module
  is fixed by an open subgroup.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.groundLevelEquiv`: `(A^V)^{U/V} ≃ A^U`.
* `TauCeti.ClassFieldTheory.NormalLayer.tateHZeroEquivNormQuotient`: degree-zero Tate cohomology
  of the layer is the norm quotient.

## Implementation notes

The coefficient module is built as `Representation.ofQuotient` of a
`Representation.subrepresentation`, so that its underlying module is *definitionally* the level
`A^V`. Mathlib's packaged `Rep.quotientToInvariants` would instead produce the invariants of the
restriction of `A` along `V ∩ U → U → G`, which is the same submodule of the ambient module but
not the same term as `A^V`, and every later comparison would have to transport along that equality.

Both `Formation` and `NormalLayer` assume that `G` is compact and totally disconnected.
Compactness makes the Galois group of every layer finite, so that the `degree` of a layer is its
genuine index and not the junk value `0` of an infinite quotient.

Both the group and the coefficient module live in `Type`. Mathlib's `tateCohomology` asks for the
finite group and the coefficient ring `ℤ` in one universe and for the coefficient module in that
same universe, and every carrier of the arithmetic instances is a `Type`, so nothing is lost.

The coefficient module is read as a plain `Rep ℤ G` through `Representation.ofDistribMulAction` at
the action `TauCeti.TopRep.distribMulAction` derives from the operators of the topological
representation. Passing instead through `ContRepresentation.toRepresentation` would carry the
`Module ℤ` instance packaged inside `TopRep`, which is not the instance `AddCommGroup.toIntModule`
that typeclass synthesis produces for an integral module, and the two are not definitionally
equal.

/-! ### Formations and their levels -/

/-- A **formation**: a smooth discrete continuous integral representation of a compact, totally
disconnected topological group. In the arithmetic applications `G` is the Galois group of a
Galois extension and the module is the multiplicative group of the top field, read additively. The
distinguished family of subgroups of the Artin–Tate definition is the family of open subgroups of
`G`, which is why the levels below are indexed by `OpenSubgroup G`. A formation is definitionally
the same type as `SmoothDiscreteTopRep ℤ G`, specialized to integral coefficients and to a
profinite group; it introduces no second representation bundle. -/
-- The underlying category of smooth discrete objects makes sense over any topological monoid, so
-- the three profinite hypotheses are mentioned nowhere in the body; they are named with a leading
-- underscore, the convention for an argument that is deliberately unused there. They are kept
-- because the theory below — finiteness of a layer's Galois group and the norm maps built from it
-- — is stated only for a profinite `G`, so a formation should never be formed over anything else.
