# The Hecke operators of level `Γ₀(N)`

`HeckeSlash/ModularForm.lean` builds, for a subgroup `G ≤ SL(2, ℤ)` and a double coset of a Hecke
triple whose two flanks are `G.map (mapGL ℚ)`, the `ℂ`-linear endomorphisms of
`ModularForm (G.map (mapGL ℝ)) k` and `CuspForm (G.map (mapGL ℝ)) k` that the coset induces. This
file instantiates that at `G = Γ₀(N)` and `Δ = Δ₀(N)`, the companion of `HeckeSlash/Gamma1.lean`
at the larger group.

Both side conditions the general construction carries are discharged once, and neither is specific
to the level: the Hecke triple is `HeckeRing/GL2/Gamma0/Basic.lean`'s instance, which also supplies
the finiteness of the right-coset index, and the positivity hypothesis is
`out_mem_glpos_of_delta0` from that same file — every element of `Δ₀(N)` has positive determinant
by definition, so no double coset of this triple ever fails it.

The operators belong to the double coset itself, not to the representatives `heckeSlashSum` sums
over: `coe_heckeSlashGamma0ModularFormEnd` and `coe_heckeSlashGamma0CuspFormEnd` rewrite the
modular-form and cusp-form operator respectively to `heckeSlashSum`, and
`heckeSlashSum_coe_eq_sum_of_rightCosets` (`HeckeSlash/Independence.lean`) then evaluates that on
*any* decomposition of `Γ₀(N) δ Γ₀(N)` into right cosets.

⚠ These are the operators of an *arbitrary* double coset, and they carry **no character**.
`Γ₀(N)` is where the nebentypus lives, so the twisted operators — the ones weighted by
`χ ∘ Delta0UpperUnit`, acting on `modFormCharSpace k χ` rather than on all of
`M_k(Γ₀(N))` — are a different construction built on top of these. This file deliberately stops
short of that: it is the untwisted `Γ₀(N)` instantiation, matching `Gamma1.lean` declaration for
declaration.

⚠ Identifying particular cosets with the classical `Tₙ` is likewise a separate milestone and is
not proved here.

## Main definitions

* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashGamma0ModularFormEnd`: the operator on `M_k(Γ₀(N))`.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.heckeSlashGamma0CuspFormEnd`: the operator on `S_k(Γ₀(N))`.

## Main results

* `HeckeRing.GL2.rightCosetRep_mem_Delta0`: the representatives of the right cosets a double
  coset decomposes into lie in `Δ₀(N)`.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.det_rightCosetRep_pos_of_delta0`: they therefore have positive determinant, with
  no hypothesis on the coset or on the flanking group.
* `HeckeRing.GL2.coe_heckeSlashGamma0ModularFormEnd`,
  `HeckeRing.GL2.coe_heckeSlashGamma0CuspFormEnd`: both operators are `heckeSlashSum` on
  underlying functions.

-- These two facts about a single representative are about `Δ₀(N)` alone: they ask nothing of `k`
-- and, unlike everything below, they do not need `N` to be nonzero. They are kept in their own
-- section so that `[NeZero N]` is introduced only for the declarations that genuinely need it,
-- the same split `HeckeRing/GL2/Gamma0/Basic.lean` makes in its own file.

/-- **The representatives lie in `Δ₀(N)`.** `rightCosetRep D v` is `δ τᵥ⁻¹` with `δ ∈ Δ₀(N)` and
`τᵥ` in the flanking copy of `Γ₀(N)`, which is a subgroup of `Δ₀(N)` — `Gamma0Image_le_Delta0` —
so the inverse stays inside it.

Both flanks being `Γ₀(N)` is what makes this hypothesis-free. The same statement holds for any
flanking `Γ₂ ≤ Δ₀(N)`, but only at the cost of an explicit containment hypothesis every caller
would have to discharge, and no such caller exists; contrast `out_mem_glpos_of_delta0`, which is
generic in both flanks because there it costs nothing. -/
