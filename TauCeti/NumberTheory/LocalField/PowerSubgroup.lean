# The `n`-th power subgroup of a local field away from the residue characteristic

Let `K` be a nonarchimedean local field and let `n` be a natural number that is invertible in
`𝒪[K]`, that is, prime to the residue characteristic. This file shows that the subgroup
`(Kˣ)ⁿ`, the range of `powMonoidHom n : Kˣ →* Kˣ`, is open, and hence closed, in `Kˣ`.

The proof exhibits an explicit open subgroup inside the range: every principal unit is an
`n`-th power. More precisely, the `n`-th power map carries each positive-depth step `U(K,i+1)` of
the unit filtration onto itself, by Hensel's lemma applied to `X ^ n - u` at the approximate root
`1`, whose derivative `n` is a unit there. Openness does not follow from any finiteness of the
quotient `Kˣ ⧸ (Kˣ)ⁿ`: a subgroup of finite index in a topological group need not be open.

As a consequence, a subgroup of `Kˣ` is open as soon as the exponent (for instance, the index) of
the quotient by it is invertible in `𝒪[K]`, since it then contains the power subgroup attached to
that exponent.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.map_powMonoidHom_unitFiltration_succ_of_isUnit`: the `n`-th power map carries
  `U(K,i+1)` onto itself.
* `TauCeti.unitFiltration_one_le_range_powMonoidHom_of_isUnit`: every principal unit is an
  `n`-th power, `U(K,1) ≤ (Kˣ)ⁿ`.
* `TauCeti.isOpen_range_powMonoidHom_of_isUnit` and
  `TauCeti.isClosed_range_powMonoidHom_of_isUnit`: the power subgroup is open and closed.
* `TauCeti.isOpen_of_isUnit_exponent` and `TauCeti.isOpen_of_isUnit_index`: a subgroup of `Kˣ`
  is open when the exponent, or the index, of the quotient by it is invertible in `𝒪[K]`.

## Implementation notes

The hypothesis `IsUnit (n : 𝒪[K])` already forces `n ≠ 0`, so no separate nonvanishing
assumption is taken. In mixed characteristic the same openness holds for every `n ≠ 0`, but
there the `p`-primary part needs the logarithm on deep units instead of Hensel's lemma at `1`,
and in equal characteristic `p` the range of `powMonoidHom p` is not open.
