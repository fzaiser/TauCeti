# The refinement category of presentations, and its functor to complete separated rings

The refinement preorder on `Presentation` (`LocalizationTopology/Presentation.lean`) has an
associated category; this file makes the assignment `p ↦ A⟨p.num / p.den⟩` a functor from it
into `CompleteSeparatedTopCommRingCat`, with the restriction morphisms of
`CompleteSeparated/Restriction.lean` as its action on arrows.

This preorder is *intended* to index the adic structure presheaf — `𝒪_X(V)` as a limit of this
functor over the presentations whose rational subset lies in `V` — but no presheaf exists in
this file's imports, and refinement is the cofactor relation on presentation data: sufficient
for containment of the rational subsets, and not proved equivalent to it.
`TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_of_rationalSubset_subset` produces the
comparison map from a containment alone, when `A⁺` consists of power-bounded elements; refinement
needs no such hypothesis.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.Presentation.completionLocObj` : the object `A⟨T/s⟩` of a
  presentation.
* `TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.Presentation.restrictionHom` : the restriction morphism of a
  refinement, from an arbitrary choice of cofactor.
* `TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.presentationFunctor` : the functor into
  `CompleteSeparatedTopCommRingCat`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.Presentation.restrictionHom_eq` : cofactor-independence — the
  morphism is computed by *any* cofactor witnessing the refinement.
* `TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.Presentation.restrictionHom_refl` and
  `…restrictionHom_comp` : the identity and composition laws, stated on `restrictionHom`
  itself so that simp-normalised goals can still reach them.

## Why the cofactor must be quantified away

A category whose arrows carried the cofactor would not be a preorder category, and the intended
index has to be one: a limit over *the presentations inside `V`* is indexed by a condition on
presentations, not by extra data. Quantifying the cofactor away is only legitimate because the
restriction morphism does not depend on it — `restrictionObjHom_congr` — which is what lets the
functor's action be defined by an arbitrary choice and still be functorial.

For the same reason the cofactor accessor and its two spec lemmas are `private` here rather than
public in `LocalizationTopology/Presentation.lean`: they name a `choose` witness with no
mathematical content, so exporting them would let a consumer depend on the choice. The public
route from `p ≤ q` to a cofactor is `Presentation.le_def`, and the public statement about
the morphism is
`Presentation.restrictionHom_eq`, which holds for every cofactor.

## Provenance

Adapted from AINTLIB's `StructurePresheafLimit.lean` (see References): the idea of indexing the
structure presheaf by presentation data rather than by rational subsets, and the refinement
relation between presentations, are that file's. The bundling differs deliberately: AINTLIB
threads `RationalLocData` records through explicit hypotheses, while here `Presentation` packs
the data so that refinement is a `Preorder` and this assignment is a functor — the shape a
categorical limit needs.

/-- **The functor `p ↦ A⟨p.num / p.den⟩`** from the refinement category into

Functoriality is `restrictionHom_refl` and `restrictionHom_comp`.

`@[expose]` is load-bearing, for a narrower reason than exposure usually carries: with the body
sealed, `presentationFunctor_map` below does not typecheck *as a statement*. Its two sides live
in `(presentationFunctor P).obj p ⟶ (presentationFunctor P).obj q` and in
`p.completionLocObj ⟶ q.completionLocObj`, and only unfolding the functor identifies those
types. `presentationFunctor_obj` is statable either
way; it is the `map` equation, and the definitional reindexing a limit over this category
needs, that the exposure provides. -/
