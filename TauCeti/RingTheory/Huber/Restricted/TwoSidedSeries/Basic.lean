# Two-sided restricted series `A⟨X, X⁻¹⟩`

Wedhorn's Example 6.39 introduces, for a Tate ring `A`, the ring of formal series
`∑_{n ∈ ℤ} aₙ Xⁿ` whose coefficients satisfy a convergence condition: for every neighbourhood `U`
of zero, all but finitely many `aₙ` lie in `U`. This module builds the underlying coefficient
object — the `A`-module of such two-sided families — together with its coefficients,
extensionality, and the decomposition of that module by degree.

The condition is exactly the one `TauCeti.Huber.IsRestricted` already expresses for the
one-sided series `A⟨X₁, …, Xₖ⟩`: a coefficient family tending to `0` along the cofinite filter,
i.e. Mathlib's `Filter.ZeroAtFilter` at `Filter.cofinite`. Nothing in that predicate refers to the
shape of the index set, so the two-sided object is the same notion indexed by `ℤ` rather than by
`Fin k →₀ ℕ`, and is built from the same Mathlib primitive
(`Filter.zeroAtFilterSubmodule`) that `TauCeti.Huber.restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule` is built
from.

## Why this file is not called `Laurent`

Two neighbouring modules already use that word for different objects, and a third meaning would be
a placement hazard:

* `TauCeti.RingTheory.Huber.Restricted.Laurent` is Wedhorn's **Example 6.38** — the *Laurent
  rational subsets* `{|f| ≤ 1}` and `{|f| ≥ 1}`, whose coordinate rings `A⟨X⟩/(f - X)` and
  `A⟨X⟩/(1 - f X)` are quotients of the **one-sided** `A⟨X⟩`. Those are the two *pieces* of the
  cover whose *overlap* is the ring this file serves.
* `TauCeti.RingTheory.Huber.LaurentSeries` is the formal Laurent series **field** `K⸨X⸩` over a
  *field* `K` with the `X`-adic topology. That is a different object in three ways: its base is a
  field rather than an arbitrary Tate ring, its series have only finitely many negative terms, and
  its topology is `X`-adic rather than coefficientwise. It is **not** reusable here; the
  distinguishing feature is precisely the convergence condition on the coefficients.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Huber.twoSidedRestrictedSubmodule`: the `A`-module of two-sided restricted families,
  the coefficient object underlying `A⟨X, X⁻¹⟩`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Huber.mem_twoSidedRestrictedSubmodule_iff_finite_notMem`: Example 6.39's defining
  condition verbatim — membership is the finiteness condition on open additive subgroups. It is
  the `ℤ` case of `NonarchimedeanAddGroup.zeroAtFilter_cofinite_iff_finite_notMem`, which is
  stated for an arbitrary index type in
  `TauCeti/Topology/Algebra/Nonarchimedean/ZeroAtFilter.lean` because neither direction of it
  looks at the index set or at series.
* `TauCeti.Huber.twoSidedRestrictedSubmodule_ext`: coefficientwise extensionality.
* `TauCeti.Huber.single_mem_twoSidedRestrictedSubmodule`: a family supported at one degree is
  restricted.
* `TauCeti.Huber.twoSidedRestrictedSubmodule_eq_sup` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.disjoint_twoSidedRestricted_nonneg_neg`: **the degree decomposition and its
  directness** — `A⟨X, X⁻¹⟩` is the sum of its non-negative and negative parts, and that sum is
  direct. This is fact (i) of Wedhorn's Lemma 8.33 at the level of coefficients, and it is what
  the diagram chase there needs; the Example 6.39 universal property does not supply it.
* `TauCeti.Huber.twoSidedRestrictedSubmodule_eq_sup_compl` and
  `TauCeti.Huber.disjoint_twoSidedRestricted_compl`: the same decomposition and directness along
  an arbitrary set of degrees and its complement, of which the sign partition above is a special
  case. Nothing in either argument uses the order on `ℤ`, only that the two sets are
  complementary.
* `Filter.ZeroAtFilter.of_eventually_eq_or_eq_zero`: zeroing coefficients keeps a family
  restricted. Stated pointwise rather than for an indicator, so it carries no decidability
  hypothesis; it is what makes the decomposition land inside the submodule rather than merely
  inside `ℤ → M`.

## Implementation notes

Only the additive and `A`-module structure and the degree decomposition are built here. The
coefficient multiplication, whose infinite antidiagonals require a summability argument in a
complete ring, is constructed in
`TauCeti.RingTheory.Huber.Restricted.TwoSidedSeries.Convolution`, and the ring structure in
`TauCeti.RingTheory.Huber.Restricted.TwoSidedSeries.Ring`.

/-- **The membership criterion in Wedhorn's form**: a family lies in the submodule exactly when,
for every open additive subgroup, only finitely many of its members lie outside. At `M = A` this
is Example 6.39's defining condition on the coefficients, verbatim.

Deliberately **not** `@[simp]`: `mem_twoSidedRestrictedSubmodule` is already `@[simp]` and rewrites
this left-hand side to `ZeroAtFilter cofinite f`, so tagging this one too fails the `simpNF` linter
— simp reaches the membership unfolding first and this lemma can never fire. The `@[simp]` stays on
the membership lemma, matching the one-sided `mem_restrictedMvPowerSeriesSubmodule`. -/
