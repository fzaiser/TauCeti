# The symmetric power of a field, charted by elementary symmetric functions

A point of the `n`-th symmetric power `Sym R n` is an unordered `n`-tuple of scalars, and the monic
polynomial `∏_{a ∈ s} (X - a)` records exactly that information: its coefficients are the
elementary symmetric functions of the tuple, up to sign. Over an algebraically closed field the
correspondence is a bijection in both directions, and composing it with Mathlib's identification of
monic degree-`n` polynomials with their lower coefficients presents `Sym K n` as the affine space
`Fin n → K`.

This is the algebraic heart of the *symmetric product chart*: for a Riemann surface `Σ` the
symmetric product `Sym^g(Σ)` is given its complex manifold structure by exactly this map, read in a
holomorphic coordinate on `Σ` — a local identification `Sym^g(ℂ) ≅ ℂ^g` whose coordinates are the
elementary symmetric functions of the `g` points. Only the pointwise algebra is settled here, and
it takes no analytic input: everything below is a statement about polynomials over a commutative
ring or a field. The topology of `Sym^g(Σ)`, its complex structure, and the analysis that uses them
are separate later steps.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Sym.toMonic`: the monic polynomial of degree `n` whose roots, with multiplicity, are the
  points of `s : Sym R n`. This is Mathlib's `Polynomial.ofMultiset` restricted to a fixed
  cardinality, repackaged so that the target subtype records the degree.
* `TauCeti.Sym.coeff_toMonic`: Vieta's formulas, that the `k`-th coefficient of `toMonic s` is
  `(-1) ^ (n - k)` times the `(n - k)`-th elementary symmetric function of `s`.
* `TauCeti.Sym.toMonic_append`, `TauCeti.Sym.toMonic_cons`, `TauCeti.Sym.toMonic_replicate`: the
  map is multiplicative in the tuple, so adjoining a point multiplies by a linear factor and a
  constant tuple gives a pure power.
* `TauCeti.Sym.roots_toMonic`, `TauCeti.Sym.toMonic_injective`, `TauCeti.Sym.mem_iff_isRoot`: over
  an integral domain the tuple is recovered from the polynomial as its root multiset, and
  `TauCeti.Sym.toMonic_ofFn_eq_of_forall_isRoot`, that a monic polynomial of degree `n` with `n`
  distinct roots is the monic polynomial of the unordered tuple of those roots.
* `TauCeti.Sym.toMonic_coeffEquiv_symm`: the inverse chart, read as a polynomial rather than as a
  root multiset, is `TauCeti.Polynomial.monicOfCoeff`, the monic polynomial with prescribed lower
  coefficients of `TauCeti/RingTheory/Polynomial/Monic/OfCoeff.lean`.
* `TauCeti.Sym.monicEquiv`: over an algebraically closed field, taking roots with multiplicity
  inverts `toMonic`, so `Sym K n` is equivalent to the monic polynomials of degree `n`.
* `TauCeti.Sym.coeffEquiv`: the resulting chart `Sym K n ≃ (Fin n → K)`, with
  `TauCeti.Sym.coeffEquiv_apply` naming its coordinates as the signed elementary symmetric
  functions and `TauCeti.Sym.coeffEquiv_symm_apply` describing the inverse as a root-taking map.
* `TauCeti.Sym.coeffEquiv_one_apply` and `TauCeti.Sym.coeffEquiv_two_apply`: the chart in degrees
  one and two, pinning down the sign convention.
* `TauCeti.Sym.toMonic_ofFn` and `TauCeti.Sym.coeffEquiv_ofFn_apply`: read on an ordered tuple
  `f : Fin n → R` through `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn`, the monic polynomial is the product
  `∏ i, (X - C (f i))` of linear factors and the chart reads off its coefficients.
* `TauCeti.Sym.exists_map_eval_esymm_eq_eval`: over a commutative ring, applying a univariate
  polynomial to every point of a tuple acts on each elementary symmetric function by evaluating a
  multivariate polynomial at the elementary symmetric functions of the tuple.
* `TauCeti.Sym.exists_coeffEquiv_map_eval_coeffEquiv_symm_eq_eval`: applying a univariate
  polynomial to every point acts by multivariate polynomials in the chart coordinates, including
  at tuples where points collide.

Lane F4.1 of the analytic Heegaard Floer roadmap opens with "`Sym^g(Σ)` geometry: smooth complex
structure (elementary symmetric functions), the totally real tori `T_α`, `T_β`, …", after
Ozsváth--Szabó ([arXiv:math/0101206](https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0101206), §2.1). This file supplies
the algebra the first clause rests on, the correspondence between an unordered tuple and its monic
polynomial, and stops there; the linear algebra behind the second clause is
`TauCeti.IsMaximalTotallyReal.finrank_eq_half` in
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/TotallyReal/Finrank.lean`. Vieta's formulas,
the root multiset of a split monic polynomial, the multiset-to-polynomial map itself, and the
equivalence between monic polynomials of degree `n` and polynomials of degree `< n` are all
Mathlib's (`Multiset.prod_X_sub_C_coeff`,
`Polynomial.prod_multiset_X_sub_C_of_monic_of_roots_card_eq`, `Polynomial.ofMultiset`,
`Polynomial.monicEquivDegreeLT`); nothing is vendored here.
