# Cyclical monotonicity for transport costs

This file defines finite `c`-cyclical monotonicity for a transport cost with values in an
additive commutative monoid equipped with a comparison relation, which covers both the
extended-nonnegative costs of the primal interface and the real costs of the `c`-transform
interface. The definition is purely
cost-theoretic: it does not require a measure, topology, or duality theory. A certified plan is
almost-everywhere concentrated on a cyclically monotone set, and that set can be taken
measurable as soon as the cost and both potentials are measurable; the converse and statements
about topological support require additional hypotheses.

This is Layer 2, item 7 of the optimal-transport roadmap.

/-- A set of pairs is `c`-*cyclically monotone* when no finite family of its points can be
improved by permuting the targets: for every finite family `(x i, y i)` in the set and every
permutation `σ`, the diagonal total cost `∑ i, c (x i, y i)` is at most the rearranged total
cost `∑ i, c (x i, y (σ i))`.

This is Villani's finite-family form of the condition. A certified plan is almost-everywhere
concentrated on a `c`-cyclically monotone set — measurably so when the cost and both potentials
are measurable; the converse and any statement about topological support need additional
hypotheses. Infinite costs allow forbidden rearrangements. -/
