# Pushing a weighted measure forward

A weight travels with the measure it weights: along a measurable equivalence `e`, the image of
`μ.withDensity f` is the image of `μ` weighted by `f ∘ e.symm`. Mathlib has this only for the
special case of a Radon–Nikodym derivative, in
`MeasurableEmbedding.map_withDensity_rnDeriv`.

Combined with a rescaling law for the measure itself, such as
`MeasureTheory.Measure.map_linearMap_addHaar_eq_smul_addHaar` on a finite-dimensional real normed
space, this gives the change-of-variables formula for a density under an invertible affine map.
That is the shape a location–scale family needs: it turns a density for the standard member of the
family into a density for every other member.

A map that is injective only on part of the line admits the same change of variables there, at the
price of restricting Lebesgue measure to that part and inserting the absolute derivative into the
weight. The substitution `x = t ^ 2` on the positive half-line is the case a square-root law needs.

## Main statements

* `MeasurableEquiv.map_withDensity`: the image of a weighted measure along a measurable
  equivalence is the image measure weighted by the transported weight.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_withDensity_eq_withDensity`: a pointwise factorization of one weight
  through a map whose Jacobian identity is already known transports that weight to the image.
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_affine_withDensity`: the image of a weighted Haar measure under an
  invertible affine map is that Haar measure weighted by the substituted density, rescaled by the
  constant Jacobian factor.
* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.map_withDensity_abs_deriv_mul`: the change of variables on the real line
  along a map injective and differentiable on a measurable set.
* `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.map_sq_withDensity_restrict_Ioi`: its instance for squaring on the
  positive half-line.

variable {α β : Type*} [MeasurableSpace α] [MeasurableSpace β]

/-- **A Jacobian identity transports a weight.** Suppose `f` carries `μ` weighted by `jac` to `ν`,
which is the Jacobian formula for `f` when `μ` and `ν` are the restrictions of a Haar measure to
the two regions `f` maps onto each other. If a weight `h` upstairs factors almost everywhere as
`jac` times a weight `g` downstairs, then `f` carries `μ.withDensity h` to `ν.withDensity g`: the
change of variables for measures upgrades to one for densities.

This is the step that turns a pointwise density computation into an identity of measures, so the
work in an application is the factorization hypothesis alone. -/

/-- **Change of variables for a weighted Lebesgue measure on the real line.** If `φ` is injective
and differentiable on a measurable set `s`, then weighting Lebesgue measure on `s` by
`|φ' t| * f (φ t)` and pushing forward along `φ` gives Lebesgue measure on the image `φ '' s`
weighted by `f`.

This is the measure-level form of Mathlib's
`MeasureTheory.lintegral_image_eq_lintegral_abs_deriv_mul`, and it carries a weight where
`MeasureTheory.map_withDensity_abs_det_fderiv_eq_addHaar` has none: that theorem is the case
`f = 1`. Unlike
`MeasurableEquiv.withDensity_ofReal_map_symm_apply_eq_integral_abs_deriv_mul`, it does not ask
`φ` to be injective off `s`, which is what a substitution on a half-line needs. The weight `f` is
arbitrary; no measurability of it is required. -/
