# Irreducible polynomials over finite fields

For every positive degree, a finite field has a monic irreducible polynomial of that degree. We
obtain one as the minimal polynomial of a primitive element of a finite extension of that degree.

Such a polynomial `f` of degree `d` over `k` presents the degree-`d` extension of `k` as the
quotient `k[X] ⧸ (f)`. Over a prime field `ZMod p` these polynomials are the irreducible factors
from which one assembles polynomials with a prescribed factorization pattern modulo `p`, as used
when reading off cycle types of Galois groups by reduction modulo primes.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_monic_irreducible_natDegree_eq`: a monic irreducible polynomial of any
  prescribed positive degree over a finite field.

## References

The construction follows Mathlib's finite-field extensions `FiniteField.Extension` and
`FiniteField.finrank_extension` (`Mathlib/FieldTheory/Finite/Extension.lean`) and its
primitive element theorem `Field.exists_primitive_element_of_finite_top`
(`Mathlib/FieldTheory/PrimitiveElement.lean`).
