# The automorphism group acting on the divisors of a function field

An `F`-automorphism `σ` of `F'` permutes the places of `F' / k`
(`TauCeti.Place.instMulActionAlgEquiv`), hence permutes the divisors of `F' / k`. Taking the
middle field to be `k` itself, this is the action of `Aut(F'/k)` on the divisor group of
`F' / k`.

The formal action is the one a permutation of the points induces on formal divisors
(`TauCeti.AlgebraicGeometry.WeilDivisor.instDistribMulAction`, a scoped instance), registered
here globally as `TauCeti.Divisor.instDistribMulActionAlgEquiv`: automorphisms do not act on the
integer coefficients, so there is no competing action. What is new here is that it is
compatible with the two pieces of structure that make a formal divisor a divisor of a function
field. The degree is preserved, because an automorphism identifies the residue field of `σ • P`
with that of `P` over the constants; and the divisor map `z ↦ div z` is equivariant, so the
action carries principal divisors to principal divisors and descends to divisor classes.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Divisor.degree_smul`: an automorphism preserves the degree of a divisor;
* `TauCeti.Divisor.principal_smul`: `div (σ z) = σ • div z`, the equivariance of the principal
  divisor map;
* `TauCeti.Divisor.smul_mem_principalSubgroup_iff` and
  `TauCeti.Divisor.linearlyEquivalent_smul_iff`: the action preserves the principal divisors and
  linear equivalence, so it descends to the divisor classes.
