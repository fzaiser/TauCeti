# Genus-zero function fields with a divisor of degree one

Let `F / k` be an algebraic function field with exact constant field.  If `F` has genus zero
and admits a divisor of degree one, then `F` is a rational function field over `k`.  This is the
nontrivial implication of Stichtenoth, *Algebraic Function Fields and Codes*, 2nd ed.,
Proposition 1.6.3.

The degree-one hypothesis is deliberately stated for an arbitrary divisor, not for a rational
place.  Riemann--Roch gives a nonzero section of that divisor.  Translating the section by its
principal divisor produces an effective divisor of degree one, whose support contains a rational
place.  At that place, the genus-zero prescribed-pole theorem produces a function with one simple
pole.  The product formula identifies the degree of the resulting rational subfield with one, so
Mathlib's `RatFunc.algEquivOfTranscendental` extends to the required equivalence.

This module proves the forward implication without weakening the degree-one-divisor hypothesis to
the existence of a rational place.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.exists_place_degree_eq_one_of_genus_eq_zero_of_divisor_degree_eq_one`: genus zero and
  a degree-one divisor produce a rational place.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_algEquiv_ratFunc_of_genus_eq_zero_of_divisor_degree_eq_one`: genus zero and a
  degree-one divisor make the function field rational.

/-- A genus-zero function field with a divisor of degree one has a rational place.

Riemann--Roch gives dimension two for the degree-one divisor.  A nonzero section translates it
to a linearly equivalent effective divisor, still of degree one, and such a divisor contains a
rational place. -/

/-- **Genus zero plus a divisor of degree one implies rationality** (the nontrivial direction of
Stichtenoth, Proposition 1.6.3).

The conclusion is an equivalence of `k`-algebras `F ≃ₐ[k] RatFunc k`.  No perfectness,
separability, or rational-place hypothesis is added: exactness of the constant field is the only
extra hypothesis required by Riemann--Roch. -/
