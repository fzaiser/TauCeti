# Unordered tuples with one point in each member of a family

Given a family `A : Fin n → Set α` of subsets of a type, `TauCeti.Sym.pi A` is the set of
unordered `n`-tuples obtained by choosing one point in each `A i`. When the members of the family
are pairwise disjoint that choice is recorded faithfully: the unordered tuple remembers which of
its points came from which member, so `TauCeti.Sym.pi A` is parametrized by the product
`∀ i, ↥(A i)` (`TauCeti.Sym.piEquiv`).

The case to keep in mind is the pair of tori `T_α = α₁ × ⋯ × α_g` and `T_β = β₁ × ⋯ × β_g` inside
the symmetric power `Sym^g(Σ)` of a Heegaard surface, attached to the two systems of attaching
curves of a Heegaard diagram (Ozsváth--Szabó, *Holomorphic disks and topological invariants for
closed three-manifolds*, §2.1). The main result here describes their intersection: a point of
`T_α ∩ T_β` is exactly a **matching**, a bijection `σ` of the index set together with a point of
`α_i ∩ β_{σ i}` for each `i`. Consequently `T_α ∩ T_β` is finite as soon as the curves meet
finitely often, and its cardinality is the permanent of the matrix of intersection numbers
`#(α_i ∩ β_j)`; these are the points that generate the Heegaard Floer chain complex. For a
genus-one diagram the permanent degenerates to the number of intersection points of the two curves.

The parametrization by ordered tuples, its injectivity for a pairwise disjoint family, and the
description of its range are `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn_map_injective` and
`TauCeti.Sym.mem_range_ofFn_map`, which this file specializes to subtype coercions. Only the
combinatorics of unordered tuples is used, so nothing here is topological; the corresponding
statements about `TauCeti.Sym.pi A` as a subspace of the topological symmetric power are in
`TauCeti/Topology/Sym/Pi.lean`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Sym.pi`: the unordered tuples with one point in each member of the family, with
  `TauCeti.Sym.pi_nonempty_iff` recording when it is inhabited.
* `TauCeti.Sym.mem_pi_iff` and `TauCeti.Sym.mem_pi_iff_card_filter`: membership, either through an
  ordered presentation or as "exactly one point in each member".
* `TauCeti.Sym.ofFn_subtypeVal_injective` and `TauCeti.Sym.piEquiv`: for a pairwise disjoint
  family, the unordered tuples in `TauCeti.Sym.pi A` are parametrized by `∀ i, ↥(A i)`.
* `TauCeti.Sym.matchingTuple` and `TauCeti.Sym.piInterEquiv`: the unordered tuple of a matching,
  and the resulting bijection between matchings and points of `pi A ∩ pi B`.
* `TauCeti.Sym.finite_pi_inter_pi` and `TauCeti.Sym.natCard_pi_inter_pi`: the intersection is
  finite when the pairwise intersections are, with cardinality the permanent of the matrix of
  their cardinalities.
