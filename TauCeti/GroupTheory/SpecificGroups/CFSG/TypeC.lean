# The standard symplectic carrier and the candidate group of a validated type-`C` index

The type-`C` branch of the classification list is built on the type-`C` diagram of rank `n`, and
Tau Ceti's explicit full-weight Chevalley carrier for that diagram is `TauCeti.SpStd.groupScheme`,
the Kostant toral closure of the standard representation of `sp_(2n)` inside `GL_(2n)` over `ℤ`.
This file attaches that carrier to a validated type-`C` index: the group of algebraic-closure-valued
points of the carrier at the index's rank, its Bourbaki-numbered simple root subgroups, and the
reading of their root characters in the type-`C` root datum the index names.

The carrier also has a `q`-power Frobenius, where `q` is the field order recorded by the index: the
endomorphism of its point group raising every matrix entry to the `q`-th power. This file records
that entrywise action, the equations it satisfies on the numbered simple-root subgroups and on the
split weight torus, where it raises the subgroup parameter and every torus coordinate to the `q`-th
power, and the description of its fixed points as the carrier points all of whose matrix entries lie
in the field of `q` elements inside the closure.

The carrier is indexed by `n` in the spelling `C (n + 1)`, so a validated index of rank `r` uses
the carrier at `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank`, which is `r - 1`. That subtraction is harmless
because `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.three_le_rank` bounds the rank below by three:
`TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank_add_one` recovers `r`, and every numbered object below is indexed
by `Fin d.1.rank`, the upstream Bourbaki index type of the index's own Dynkin type, rather than by a
node of the carrier. The two numberings agree node for node, so
`TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierNode` is the rank identification and nothing more; that is what
`TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_carrierNode_eq_root_simpleIndex` records, reading the
character of the `i`-th raising subgroup as the `i`-th simple root of the type-`C` root datum the
index names.

The rank-two member of the same carrier family is *not* reached from here. `TauCeti.DynkinType.C 2`
is not a valid Dynkin type, the rank-two root system being carried by `B 2`, and correspondingly a
validated type-`C` index has rank at least three. The rank-two carrier serves the Suzuki family
instead, in `TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeB/Two.lean`, where the node correspondence
acquires the swap of the two Bourbaki nodes.

The family is untwisted, so its Steinberg endomorphism is that Frobenius outright:
`TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.diagramPerm_eq_one` records that the diagram permutation attached to the
index is trivial, and `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.steinberg` is the Frobenius read as the Steinberg map.
The candidate group of the family is then the derived subgroup of the Steinberg fixed points modulo
the centre of that derived subgroup,

```text
H_d = fixedSubgroup d.steinberg,        d.Group = [H_d, H_d] / Z([H_d, H_d]).
```

Nothing here asserts that the carrier is reductive, that its weight torus is maximal, that it is
the symplectic group scheme or the pinned simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group scheme of type
`Cₙ`, or that its point group or any group formed from it is finite, perfect, or simple. The
Steinberg endomorphism and the candidate group transfer to that pinned group scheme only along an
identification of the carrier with it, once one is proved.

## Main declarations

  symplectic carrier at the index's rank.
* `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.simpleRootSubgroup`: its positive simple-root subgroup at a

  simple-root subgroups and split weight torus.

/-! ## The carrier rank and the node correspondence -/

/-- **The rank parameter of the standard symplectic carrier serving a validated type-`C` index.**
`TauCeti.SpStd.groupScheme n` is the carrier of type `C (n + 1)`, so the carrier serving an index
of rank `r` is the one at `r - 1`. The subtraction never truncates, `r` being at least three by
`TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.three_le_rank`; `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank_add_one` is the
identification that recovers `r`. -/
def carrierRank : ℕ := d.1.rank - 1

/-- The carrier rank of a validated type-`C` index is one less than its rank. It is oriented
towards `TauCeti.ValidLieTypeIndex.rank`, so that `simp` normalizes the successor of the carrier
rank to the rank the index's own Bourbaki index type is built on. -/

  -- The body is unexposed, so the subtraction has to be unfolded before `omega` sees it.
  rw [carrierRank]
  omega

/-- **The carrier node numbered by a Bourbaki node of the index's diagram.** Unlike the rank-two
correspondence of the Suzuki family, this is the rank identification and nothing else: the standard
symplectic carrier at `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank` numbers its generators by the Bourbaki
numbering of the type-`C` diagram that the index names, node for node. -/

  Fin.cast d.carrierRank_add_one.symm i

/-- **The node correspondence transports the type-`C` Cartan matrix.** The entry at a pair of
carrier nodes is the entry at the pair of Bourbaki nodes they number: `carrierNode` moves no node
value, only the rank its index type is built on, and `TauCeti.TypeCLieIndex.carrierRank_add_one`
identifies the two ranks. -/

/-! ## The ambient group and its simple root subgroups -/

/-- **The ambient group this file attaches to a validated type-`C` index**: the points of the
explicit full-weight standard symplectic Chevalley carrier at the index's rank, over the algebraic
closure of its prime field. No finiteness, reductivity, pinning or maximality statement is attached
to it, and it is not claimed to be the points of the pinned simply connected group scheme of type
`Cₙ`, no identification of the two carriers being proved. -/

/-- **The simple-root subgroups sit at the simple roots of the type-`C` root datum.** The character
by which the carrier's split torus rescales the parameter of `simpleRootSubgroup i`, read in the
same node correspondence, is the `i`-th simple root of
`TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` at the Dynkin type the index names. This is the sense
in which the standard symplectic carrier serves that diagram; it is not a claim that the carrier is
the pinned group of the diagram, no pinning being constructed for it. -/
