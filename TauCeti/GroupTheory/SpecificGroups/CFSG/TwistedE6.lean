# The graph-twisted family `²E₆(q)` on the doubled minuscule carrier

The classification list carries two families on the `E₆` diagram: the untwisted `E₆(q)`, whose
Steinberg map is the `q`-power Frobenius, and the graph-twisted `²E₆(q)`, whose Steinberg map is
that Frobenius composed with the order-two symmetry `γ₂` of the diagram. The twisted construction
needs a carrier on which that symmetry acts: the `E₆` diagram symmetry exchanges the minuscule
representation `V(ϖ₁)` with its contragredient `V(ϖ₆)` rather than preserving either, so it does
not act on the `27`-dimensional carrier `TauCeti.E6Minuscule.groupScheme` that
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeE6.lean` runs the untwisted recipe on, and this file
cannot reuse that carrier. The graph-stable carrier
is `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.groupScheme`, built on `V(ϖ₁) ⊕ V(ϖ₆)` inside `GL₅₄` over `ℤ`.

This file attaches that carrier to a validated `²E₆` index and forms the family's Steinberg
endomorphism and candidate group on it. It supplies the group of algebraic-closure-valued points
and the Bourbaki-numbered simple root subgroups, identifies the character of those subgroups with
the corresponding simple root of the `E₆` root datum, and builds the two factors of the Steinberg
map. The first is the `q`-power Frobenius `Frob_q`, with the pinned equation
`Frob_q (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ q)` and the description of its fixed points as the points all of whose
`54 × 54` matrix entries lie in the field of definition `𝔽_q`. The second is the graph automorphism
`γ₂`, conjugation by the signed monomial matrix of the carrier that exchanges its two minuscule
summands, with the pinned equation `γ₂ (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u)` for `σ` the diagram permutation the
index carries, which exchanges the Bourbaki nodes `1 ↔ 6` and `3 ↔ 5`. The graph automorphism is an
involution and commutes with the Frobenius, so the Steinberg map of the family is the composite

```text
F = γ₂ ∘ Frob_q = Frob_q ∘ γ₂,        F (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u ^ q),
```

and the candidate group of `²E₆(q)` is the derived subgroup of the fixed points of `F`, modulo the
centre of that derived subgroup. The Frobenius fixed points are the points with entries in `𝔽_q`;
the fixed points of the composite are not characterized here.

The doubled minuscule carrier is not identified with the pinned simply connected
Chevalley--Demazure group scheme of type `E₆`, and nothing here identifies the two: the
constructions below transfer to that pinned group only along such an identification, once one is
proved. Nor is it asserted that the carrier is reductive, that its weight torus is maximal, or that
any group mentioned is finite, perfect, or simple.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.AmbientGroup`: the algebraic-closure-valued points of the doubled
  minuscule carrier, the group the classification recipe for `²E₆(q)` is run inside.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.simpleRootSubgroup`: its positive simple-root subgroup at a
  Bourbaki-numbered node.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.frobenius`: the `q`-power Frobenius factor of the Steinberg map,
  at the field order the index records.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.graphAut`: the graph automorphism factor, realizing on the ambient
  group the diagram permutation the index carries.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.steinberg`: the Steinberg endomorphism `γ₂ ∘ Frob_q` of `²E₆(q)`.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.FixedPoints` and `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.Group`: the fixed
  subgroup of the Steinberg map, and the candidate group `FixedPointCandidate steinberg`, the
  quotient `[H, H] / Z([H, H])` of those fixed points `H`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_eq_root_simpleIndex`: the character of a
  simple-root subgroup is the corresponding simple root of
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` at `E₆`.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.frobenius_simpleRootSubgroup`: the pinned equation
  `Frob_q (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ q)` on the numbered simple-root subgroups.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.mem_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_iff`: a point is fixed by `Frob_q`
  exactly when all entries of its `54 × 54` matrix lie in the field of definition.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.e6DoubledMinusculeWeight_e6DoubledMinusculeGraphPerm_diagramPerm`:
  the coordinate involution of the doubled index set is equivariant for the diagram permutation
  that the index itself carries, read in the index's copy `Fin d.1.rank` of the Bourbaki index
  type.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.e6DoubledMinusculeGraphPerm_pow_twistOrder`: the twist order the
  index records annihilates that involution.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.graphAut_simpleRootSubgroup`: the pinned equation
  `γ₂ (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u)`, with no field power and no sign.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.graphAut_sq`,
  `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.graphAut_pow_twistOrder` and
  `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.graphAut_comp_frobenius`: `γ₂ ^ 2 = 1`, also in the form the twist
  order of the index states it, and `γ₂` commutes with `Frob_q`.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.steinberg_simpleRootSubgroup`: the pinned equation
  `F (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u ^ q)` of the Steinberg map.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.steinberg_def` and
  `TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.steinberg_eq_frobenius_comp_graphAut`: the Steinberg map is the
  composite of its two factors, in either order.

/-! ## The ambient group and its simple root subgroups -/

/-- **The ambient group this file attaches to a validated `²E₆` index**: the points of the explicit
full-weight graph-stable type-`E₆` doubled minuscule Chevalley carrier over the algebraic closure
of its prime field. No finiteness, reductivity, pinning or maximality statement is attached to it,
and it is not identified with the points of the pinned simply connected `E₆` group scheme, as the
module docstring describes. -/
abbrev AmbientGroup : Type := E6DoubledMinuscule.points d.1.Closure

/-- The positive simple-root subgroup at the Bourbaki-numbered node `i` of the `E₆` diagram. It is
the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the same node, the index type `Fin d.1.rank` being the
upstream Bourbaki index type of the index's own Dynkin type. -/
def simpleRootSubgroup (i : Fin d.1.rank) : Multiplicative d.1.Closure →* d.AmbientGroup :=
  E6DoubledMinuscule.rootSubgroupPoints (.inl (finCongr d.rank_eq_six i)) d.1.Closure

/-- The simple-root subgroup is the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the corresponding node.
This is the equation through which the upstream root-subgroup API reaches `simpleRootSubgroup`. It
is deliberately not a `simp` lemma: the pinned equations `γ₂ (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u)` and
`Frob_q (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ q)` of this branch's Steinberg map are stated against
`simpleRootSubgroup` itself, and unfolding to `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.rootSubgroupPoints` would
keep them from firing, as it does on the branches already assembled. -/
theorem simpleRootSubgroup_def (i : Fin d.1.rank) :
    d.simpleRootSubgroup i =
      E6DoubledMinuscule.rootSubgroupPoints (.inl (finCongr d.rank_eq_six i)) d.1.Closure :=
  (rfl)

/-- **The simple-root subgroups sit at the simple roots of the `E₆` root datum.** The character by
which the carrier's split torus rescales the parameter of `simpleRootSubgroup i`, pinned by
`TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.weightTorus_conj_rootSubgroup`, is the `i`-th simple root of
`TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` at `E₆`, in the same Bourbaki numbering.

The characters themselves are shared with the `27`-dimensional carrier, `TauCeti.E6Minuscule`
having defined them from the `E₆` Cartan matrix alone, so this is the same identification the
untwisted branch records in `TauCeti.TypeE6LieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_eq_root_simpleIndex`, on
the index subtype of this branch. It is not a claim that the doubled carrier is the pinned group of
that diagram, no pinning being constructed for it. -/

/-! ## The diagram symmetry on the carrier's coordinates -/

/-- **The coordinate involution of the doubled index set realizes the diagram permutation that the
index carries.** `TauCeti.DynkinType.e6DoubledMinusculeGraphPerm` exchanges the two minuscule
summands, and this is the equivariance `wt (π x) (σ i) = wt x i` of the doubled weight family for
it, with `σ` read as `TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.diagramPerm` of this index rather than as
`TauCeti.graphPermE6` directly. That equivariance is the hypothesis under which a numbered
permutation of the coordinates extends to an automorphism of a Kostant toral-closure carrier, and
stating it against the index's own permutation is what identifies the resulting automorphism
`graphAut` as the graph factor `γ₂` of this family's Steinberg map rather than an unrelated
symmetry.

The minuscule weight family alone admits no such equivariance, by
`TauCeti.DynkinType.e6MinusculeWeight_comp_graphPermE6_notMem_range`; that is why this branch is
built on the doubled carrier. -/

/-- **The twist order of the index annihilates the coordinate involution.** Together with
`TauCeti.GraphTwistedIndex.diagramPerm_pow_twistOrder` on the diagram side, this is the pair of
order relations that `graphAut_pow_twistOrder` below matches on the carrier: `γ₂ ^ 2 = 1`. -/

/-! ## The Frobenius factor of the Steinberg map -/

/-- **The `q`-power Frobenius endomorphism of the ambient group of a validated `²E₆` index**, `q`
being the field order the index records.

It is *not* the Steinberg map of the family, which for a graph-twisted family is `γ₂ ∘ Frob_q`.
On this branch the two genuinely differ: the composite acts on the simple-root subgroups through
the diagram permutation the index carries, which is `TauCeti.graphPermE6` by
`TauCeti.TypeTwistedE6LieIndex.diagramPerm_toGraphTwistedIndex` and has order two by
`TauCeti.orderOf_graphPermE6`. This is the right-hand factor of that composite, and the subgroup of
points it fixes, characterized below, is correspondingly the untwisted one and not the fixed
subgroup of the composite. -/

closure, the Frobenius-fixed subgroup is therefore the group of points of the doubled minuscule
carrier with coordinates in `𝔽_q`. It is not the group of points fixed by the twisted composite
`γ₂ ∘ Frob_q`, which is the one the classification recipe for this branch is run inside. -/
