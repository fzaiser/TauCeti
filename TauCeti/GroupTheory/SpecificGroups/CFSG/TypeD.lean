# The three families on a type-`D` diagram, and the candidate groups of `Dₙ(q)` and `²Dₙ(q)`

Three classification-list families are built on the diagram `Dₙ`: the untwisted `Dₙ(q)`, the
graph-twisted `²Dₙ(q)`, and, at rank four, the triality-twisted `³D₄(q)`. They share a diagram, so
they share a carrier, and `TauCeti.TypeDDiagramLieIndex` is the subtype that collects exactly them.
This file attaches to such an index the group of algebraic-closure-valued points of Tau Ceti's
explicit full-weight type-`D` spin Chevalley carrier at the index's own rank,
`TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.points`, together with that group's Bourbaki-numbered simple root
subgroups and its `q`-power Frobenius; and it then forms the Steinberg endomorphism and the
candidate group on the untwisted branch, where the Frobenius *is* the Steinberg map, and on the
graph-twisted branch, where the Steinberg map is the Frobenius composed with the fork-exchange
graph automorphism of the carrier.

The rank is available because it is at least four on this subtype, by
`TauCeti.TypeDDiagramLieIndex.four_le_rank`, which is exactly the hypothesis the carrier takes: the
carrier is built from the type-`Dₙ` Serre presentation, whose diagram is `A₁ × A₁` at rank two and
`A₃` at rank three, so it is offered only in the range where `Dₙ` is a valid Dynkin type.

The spin carrier rather than the Geck carrier is used because the Geck carrier is built from the
adjoint representation, so its weights span the whole character lattice exactly in the types `E₈`,
`F₄` and `G₂`, by `TauCeti.DynkinType.span_range_geckWeight_eq_top_iff`. A type-`D` diagram is not
one of those, by `TauCeti.LieTypeIndex.not_hasUnimodularDiagram_of_hasTypeDDiagram`, and the full
spin representation is what sees both spinor cosets of the type-`D` root lattice; its weights span
that lattice, by `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.span_range_basisWeight_eq_top`.

## The three Steinberg maps

The three families differ exactly in the endomorphism whose fixed points the classification recipe
takes. On the untwisted branch that endomorphism is the `q`-power Frobenius outright, and
`TauCeti.TypeDLieIndex.diagramPerm_toGraphTwistedIndex` checks that the diagram permutation the
index carries is trivial. So `TauCeti.TypeDLieIndex.steinberg` is the shared Frobenius, and the
recipe

```text
H_d = fixedSubgroup d.steinberg,        d.Group = [H_d, H_d] / Z([H_d, H_d])
```

runs on this branch, on the spin carrier.

On the graph-twisted branch the Steinberg map is `γ₂ ∘ Frob_q`, where `γ₂` is the graph
automorphism `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAutPoints` of the carrier, conjugation by a signed
permutation matrix of the spin coordinates. It realizes the diagram permutation the index carries,
the fork exchange `TauCeti.graphPermD`, by the pinned equation `γ₂ (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u)` on the
simple-root subgroups, it is an involution, and it commutes with the Frobenius, so that

```text
F = γ₂ ∘ Frob_q = Frob_q ∘ γ₂,        F (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u ^ q).
```

`TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.steinberg` is this composite and the same recipe runs on it. The
Frobenius fixed points are the points with entries in `𝔽_q`; the fixed points of the composite are
not characterized here.

The triality-twisted branch takes `γ₃ ∘ Frob_q` for an order-three symmetry that the spin carrier
does not carry: triality permutes the three eight-dimensional representations of `D₄`, and the spin
module `8ₛ ⊕ 8_c` is not stable under it. No Steinberg map and no candidate group is formed on that
branch here; the Frobenius supplied on the shared carrier is the factor it composes with.

The spin carrier is not identified with the pinned simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group
scheme of type `Dₙ`, and nothing here identifies the two: the constructions below transfer to that
pinned group only along such an identification, once one is proved. Nor is it asserted that the
carrier is reductive, that its weight torus is maximal, or that any group below is finite, perfect,
or simple.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.TypeDDiagramLieIndex.AmbientGroup`: the algebraic-closure-valued points of the
  full-weight type-`D` spin carrier at the rank the index names, the group inside which the
  classification recipe is run on the two branches below.
* `TauCeti.TypeDDiagramLieIndex.simpleRootSubgroup`: the positive simple-root subgroup at a
  Bourbaki node.
* `TauCeti.TypeDDiagramLieIndex.rootGeneratorWeight_eq_root_simpleIndex`: the character of that
  subgroup is the corresponding simple root of the root datum of the Dynkin type the index names.
* `TauCeti.TypeDDiagramLieIndex.frobenius`, `TauCeti.TypeDDiagramLieIndex.coe_frobenius_apply` and
  `TauCeti.TypeDDiagramLieIndex.frobenius_simpleRootSubgroup`: the `q`-power Frobenius, its
  entrywise description, and its pinned equation `Frob_q (x_i(u)) = x_i(u ^ q)`.
* `TauCeti.TypeDDiagramLieIndex.mem_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_iff`: its fixed points are the points
  whose matrix entries lie in the field of definition `𝔽_q`.
* `TauCeti.TypeDLieIndex.steinberg` and `TauCeti.TypeDLieIndex.Group`: the Steinberg endomorphism
  of the untwisted family `Dₙ(q)`, which is the Frobenius, and its candidate group.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.graphAut`, with
  `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.graphAut_simpleRootSubgroup`,
  `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.graphAut_sq`,
  `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.graphAut_pow_twistOrder` and
  `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.graphAut_comp_frobenius`: the fork-exchange graph automorphism of
  the ambient group of a `²Dₙ` index, its pinned equation `γ₂ (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u)`, the relation
  `γ₂ ^ 2 = 1`, also in the form the twist order of the index states it, and its commutation with
  the Frobenius.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.steinberg`, with `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.steinberg_def`,
  `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.steinberg_eq_frobenius_comp_graphAut` and
  `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.steinberg_simpleRootSubgroup`: the Steinberg endomorphism
  `γ₂ ∘ Frob_q` of `²Dₙ(q)`, its two factorizations, and its pinned equation
  `F (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u ^ q)`.
* `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.FixedPoints` and `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.Group`: the fixed
  subgroup of that Steinberg map, and the candidate group of `²Dₙ(q)`.

/-! ## The ambient group and its simple root subgroups -/

/-- **The ambient group this file attaches to a validated index on a type-`D` diagram**: the points
of the explicit full-weight type-`Dₙ` spin Chevalley carrier, at the rank the index names, over the
algebraic closure of its prime field.

It is infinite, and it is the same group for the untwisted, graph-twisted and triality-twisted
families of a given rank and field order, those three differing only in the Steinberg map taken of
it. No finiteness, reductivity, pinning or maximality statement is attached to it, and it is not
identified with the points of the pinned simply connected `Dₙ` group scheme, as the module
docstring describes. -/
abbrev AmbientGroup : Type :=
  TypeDSpinCarrier.points d.1.rank d.four_le_rank d.1.Closure

/-- The classification recipe runs its fixed-point and quotient construction inside this group, so
it carries a group structure; the carrier being a subgroup of a general linear group supplies
it. -/
example : Group d.AmbientGroup := inferInstance

/-- The positive simple-root subgroup at the Bourbaki-numbered node `i` of the `Dₙ` diagram. It is
the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the same node, the index type `Fin d.1.rank` being the
upstream Bourbaki index type of the index's own Dynkin type and the carrier's own rank. -/
def simpleRootSubgroup (i : Fin d.1.rank) : Multiplicative d.1.Closure →* d.AmbientGroup :=
  TypeDSpinCarrier.rootSubgroupPoints d.1.rank d.four_le_rank (.inl i) d.1.Closure

/-- The simple-root subgroup is the carrier's numbered raising subgroup at the corresponding node.
This is the equation through which the upstream root-subgroup API reaches `simpleRootSubgroup`,
whose definition itself stays sealed.

It is deliberately not a `simp` lemma: `frobenius_simpleRootSubgroup` is the normal form the pinned
equations of this file are stated against, and unfolding to
`TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.rootSubgroupPoints` would keep it from firing. -/

/-- **The simple-root subgroups sit at the simple roots of the type-`Dₙ` root datum.** The
character by which the carrier's split torus rescales the parameter of `simpleRootSubgroup i` is
the `i`-th simple root of `TauCeti.DynkinType.simplyConnectedRootDatum` at the Dynkin type the
index names, in the same Bourbaki numbering. This is the sense in which the spin carrier serves
that diagram; it is not a claim that the carrier is the pinned group of the diagram, no pinning
being constructed for it.

The character itself is `TauCeti.TypeDStd.rootGeneratorWeight`, which
`TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.weightTorusPoints_conj_rootSubgroupPoints` exhibits as the one conjugation
by the carrier's split torus rescales the parameter by. -/

Steinberg map itself, by `TauCeti.TypeDLieIndex.steinberg_def`. On the two twisted families it is
not: there the Steinberg map is `γ ∘ Frob_q` for a nontrivial diagram permutation, and this is the
factor that composite composes with, as `TauCeti.TypeTwistedDLieIndex.steinberg_def` records on the
graph-twisted family. -/
