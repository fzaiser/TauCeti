# Stacking Brauer diagrams is associative

Vertical stacking of Brauer diagrams, `TauCeti.composeDiagram`, is associative: stacking `D₁`
above `D₂` and the result above `D₃` gives the same matching of the outer boundary as stacking
`D₂` above `D₃` and `D₁` above that. This is the underlying-matching half of the associativity
of the Brauer algebra, whose multiplication is the composite diagram weighted by `δ` raised to
the middle-loop count of `TauCeti/Combinatorics/Brauer/LoopCount.lean`.

Associativity is what makes the stacking of diagrams the multiplication of an associative
algebra, so it is the law every consumer of the Brauer algebra rests on.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.composeDiagram_assoc`: **stacking Brauer diagrams is associative.**

-- The proof reads both bracketings off one and the same walk, the walk along a strand of the
-- three-fold stack of `D₁` above `D₂` above `D₃`. That stack has two middle boundaries, an upper
-- one between `D₁` and `D₂` and a lower one between `D₂` and `D₃`, and a strand that has reached a
-- middle point is about to run either up or down through one of the three diagrams; the four
-- resulting middle states, together with the outer point at which the strand has already left the
-- stack, are the positions of the walk.
--
-- Only one direction of the comparison is needed in each bracketing, because the walk is a
-- function: a strand leaves the three-fold stack at most once, so the outer point at which it
-- leaves is unique. So it suffices to prove of each bracketing that the point it matches with `x`
-- is a point at which the strand of the three-fold stack starting at `x` leaves, and the two are
-- then equal without ever chopping a walk of the three-fold stack into walks of a two-fold one.
--
-- That one direction is in turn a simulation statement, and the same one twice. A two-fold stack
-- occurring inside a bracketing embeds into the three-fold stack: its middle states are two of the
-- four, and the outer points at which its strands leave are either genuine outer points of the
-- three-fold stack or middle states of it. Under that embedding one step of the two-fold walk is
-- at most finitely many steps of the three-fold walk -- one step where the two-fold stack uses a
-- diagram directly, and the walk of the inner stack where it uses a composite -- and
-- `TauCeti.exists_iterate_of_forall_exists_iterate` turns that into the same statement for
-- iterates.

/-! ### The walk along a strand of a stack of two diagrams -/

/-- The walk along a strand of the stack of `D₁` above `D₂`, as a **total** function on the
positions `TauCeti.stackStep` takes its values in: an outer point at which the strand has
already left the stack stays put, and a middle state is carried on by `TauCeti.stackStep`. -/

/-! ### The walk along a strand of a stack of three diagrams -/

/-- The positions of the walk along a strand of the stack of `D₁` above `D₂` above `D₃`.

`Sum.inl y` records that the strand has left the stack at the outer point `y`, a bottom point of
`D₃` or a top point of `D₁`. The remaining positions are the middle states, a point of one of the
two middle boundaries together with the diagram the strand runs through next: on the **upper**
middle boundary, between `D₁` and `D₂`, the strand runs up through `D₁` at
`Sum.inr (Sum.inl (Sum.inl a))` and down through `D₂` at `Sum.inr (Sum.inl (Sum.inr a))`; on the
**lower** one, between `D₂` and `D₃`, it runs up through `D₂` at
`Sum.inr (Sum.inr (Sum.inl a))` and down through `D₃` at `Sum.inr (Sum.inr (Sum.inr a))`. -/
