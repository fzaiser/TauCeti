# The successor array of a sequence

For a sequence `x : ℕ → α`, its successor array records, for each value `a`, the values that
follow successive visits to `a`. Together with `x 0`, this array determines the original sequence.
The reconstruction is total: entries after the last genuine visit use the junk value supplied by
`Nat.nth`, but the round-trip theorem never reads them.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.visitCount`: the number of visits to a value before a given index.
* `TauCeti.visitTime`: the index of a given visit to a value.
* `TauCeti.successorArray`: the values following successive visits to each value.
* `TauCeti.visitedSuccessorArray`: the successor array with the rows of unvisited values reset to
  constants.
* `TauCeti.visitCell`: the cell of the successor array a sequence uses at a given time.
* `TauCeti.pathOfSuccessors`: reconstruction from an initial value and successor array.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.visitCount_monotone`: visit counts are monotone in the horizon.
* `TauCeti.visitCount_add`: a visit count splits at any intermediate index.
* `TauCeti.visitTime_eq_of_eqOn`: a visit time is read off any sequence agreeing with the original
  up to that time.
* `TauCeti.successorArray_visitCount`: the defining step relation of the successor array.
* `TauCeti.visitTime_eq_iff`: the fibres of the visit times, including the junk-value branch.
* `TauCeti.successorArray_eq_successorArray_zero_of_forall_ne`: the successor row of a value the
  sequence never visits is constant, and repeats the cell the starting value indexes.
* `TauCeti.apply_visitTime_of_infinite` and `TauCeti.visitTime_strictMono_of_infinite`: visit
  times are genuine and strictly increasing when the value occurs infinitely often.
* `TauCeti.apply_visitTime_of_le` and `TauCeti.visitTime_lt_visitTime_of_le`: the same two facts
  below a visit that is known to exist.
* `TauCeti.visitTime_lt_of_lt_visitCount`: a visit indexed below a visit count is realised before
  the horizon.
* `TauCeti.apply_visitTime_of_lt_visitCount`: such an index names a genuine visit.
* `TauCeti.visitCount_visitTime_of_lt_visitCount`: exactly the indexed number of visits precede
  that visit.
* `TauCeti.occCount_succ_add_zero_eq_visitCount_add_last`: the arrival/departure balance of a
  finite prefix.
* `TauCeti.successorArray_pathOfSuccessors_of_lt_visitCount`: a reconstruction consumes exactly the
  successor entries it was prescribed.
* `TauCeti.eq_pathOfSuccessors`: the uniqueness principle for the reconstruction.
* `TauCeti.pathOfSuccessors_successorArray`: reconstruction inverts the successor decomposition.
* `TauCeti.visitCell_injective`: distinct times use distinct cells.
* `TauCeti.eqOn_iff_successorArray_visitCell`: a finite initial segment of a sequence is pinned
  down by its initial value together with the successor-array entries at the cells that segment
  designates. This is the finite-horizon form of `TauCeti.eq_pathOfSuccessors`, and the form a
  finite-path event needs: the cells are read off a *reference* sequence, so they do not move with
  the sequence being described. `TauCeti.eqOn_iff_visitCell_of_apply_visitCell_eq_succ` is the same
  criterion for any array agreeing with the successor array at the cells the sequence consumes,
  such as `TauCeti.visitedSuccessorArray`.
