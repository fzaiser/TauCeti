# The discriminant and the signed discriminant of a regular quadratic form

Over a field in which two is invertible, a regular quadratic form is diagonalizable, and the
product of the weights of a diagonalization is well defined modulo squares. That square class is
the **discriminant** `d(q)`; correcting it by the sign `(-1)^{m(m-1)/2}` in rank `m` gives the
**signed discriminant** `d±(q)`, the variant that vanishes on a hyperbolic plane and is unchanged
by adding one.

Both invariants are defined on `TauCeti.RegularFormClass`, the carrier of isometry classes of
regular forms, so they are invariants of a form up to isometry by construction. Well-definedness
is a Gram-determinant computation: the Gram matrix of a diagonal presentation in the standard
basis is the diagonal matrix of its weights, and an isometry of the coordinate spaces changes that
matrix by a congruence, hence changes its determinant — the product of the weights — by the square
of a unit.

The sign is recorded as `m.choose 2` rather than as the truncated quotient `m * (m - 1) / 2`; the
two agree by `Nat.choose_two_right`, and only the parity matters, because the square-class group
is killed by two.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.discr` and `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.discrHom`: the discriminant of an
  isometry class, and its packaging as an additive homomorphism for the orthogonal sum.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.signedDiscr`: the signed discriminant.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.squareClass_prod_eq_of_equivalent`: isometric diagonal presentations have weight
  products in the same square class.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.discr_add` and `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.discr_mul`: the discriminant
  of an orthogonal sum is the sum of the discriminants, and the discriminant of a tensor product
  of classes of ranks `m` and `n` is `d(q)^n d(r)^m`.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.signedDiscr_add` and `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.signedDiscr_mul`: the
  signed discriminant of an orthogonal sum picks up the sign `(-1)^{mn}`, and that of a tensor
  product is `(-1)^{mn(mn-1)/2} d(q)^n d(r)^m`.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.discr_mk_rankOne_mul` and
  `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.signedDiscr_mk_rankOne_mul`: scaling by `a` adds
  `m • squareClass a` to the (signed) discriminant of a class of rank `m`.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.signedDiscr_mk_rankOne`: `d±⟨a⟩ = squareClass a`.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.discr_hyperbolicClass` and
  `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.signedDiscr_hyperbolicClass`: the discriminant of a hyperbolic plane
  is the class of `-1`, and its signed discriminant is trivial.
* `TauCeti.RegularFormClass.signedDiscr_add_hyperbolicClass`: adding a hyperbolic plane leaves the
  signed discriminant unchanged.
