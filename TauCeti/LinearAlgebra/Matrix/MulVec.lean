# Iterated matrix-vector multiplication

Multiplying a vector by a matrix twice is multiplying it by the square of the matrix, so a
square-zero matrix annihilates every vector in two steps. This is the form in which the nilpotence
of a root operator reaches the vector it acts on.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.mulVec_mulVec_eq_zero_of_pow_two_eq_zero`: a square-zero matrix annihilates every
  vector in two multiplications.
