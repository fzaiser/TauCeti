# Matrix entries lying in an ideal

An ideal containing every entry of a matrix contains every entry of any two-sided product
formed from it, and every entry of any linear combination of matrices whose entries it
contains: each such entry is an `S`-combination of entries of the original matrices.

Nothing here needs invertibility, a square shape, or a diagonal target — only that the products
are conformable — so the statements are at `CommSemiring` and rectangular. They are the
membership computations a defining-ideal closure proof performs when it propagates a relation
through a matrix identity.

## Main results

* `Matrix.mul_mul_apply_mem`: every entry of `P * A * Q` lies in an ideal containing every entry
  of `A`.
* `Matrix.sum_smul_apply_mem`: every entry of `∑ a, c a • F a` lies in an ideal containing every
  entry of every `F a`.
