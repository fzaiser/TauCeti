# Products of diagonal matrices and matrix units

This file records a generic matrix identity for multiplying a rectangular matrix unit on both
sides by diagonal matrices of the corresponding row and column sizes.

## Main result

* `TauCeti.diagonal_mul_single_mul_diagonal`: multiplying `Eᵢⱼ(c)` on the left and right by
  diagonal matrices rescales its entry by the corresponding diagonal coefficients.
