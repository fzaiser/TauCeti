# Reflecting a representation at a sink

For a sink `i` of a quiver `Q` -- a vertex no arrow leaves -- the Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev
construction turns a representation `M` of `Q` into a representation of the reflected quiver
`TauCeti.Quiver.Reflect Q i`, in which every arrow at `i` points the other way. Away from `i`
nothing changes; at `i` the vector space `Mᵢ` is replaced by the kernel of the map

`⨁_{a : b ⟶ i} M_b → Mᵢ`

that sums the actions of the arrows into `i`, and each reversed arrow acts by the corresponding
coordinate projection out of that kernel. This file builds that representation and computes its
dimension vector, and bundles the construction as a functor on representations.

The content of the computation is that on dimension vectors the construction realizes the simple
reflection `sᵢ` of `TauCeti.RepresentationTheory.Quiver.Reflection.DimensionVector`, provided the
summing map is surjective: the reflected space at `i` then has dimension
`∑_b #(b ⟶ i) · dim M_b - dim Mᵢ`, which is exactly `sᵢ` applied to the dimension vector of `M`,
because a sink has no outgoing arrow. Surjectivity is the honest hypothesis here and it is not
automatic: it fails exactly the way `TauCeti.incomingSum_not_surjective` records, for a
representation concentrated at `i` whose space at `i` is nontrivial, of which the vertex simple
`Sᵢ` is the example. The reflection has zero vertex space at `i` in this boundary case, by
`TauCeti.subsingleton_reflectRep_obj_self`; in particular, it kills the vertex simple `Sᵢ`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.incomingSum`: the map `⨁_{a : b ⟶ i} M_b → Mᵢ` summing the arrows into a vertex,
  defined at every vertex of every representation, whose range contains the image of every arrow
  into that vertex (`TauCeti.map_toPath_mem_range_incomingSum`).
* `TauCeti.reflectRep`: the reflection `C⁺ᵢ M` of a representation at a sink `i`, a
  representation of `TauCeti.Quiver.Reflect Q i`.
* `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor`: the BGP reflection functor at a sink.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.incomingSum_single`: the incoming sum of a family supported at one arrow is the action
  of that arrow.
* `TauCeti.incomingSum_naturality`: the incoming sum is natural in the representation.
* `TauCeti.reflectRep_obj_self` and `TauCeti.reflectRep_obj_of_ne`: the vertex spaces of `C⁺ᵢ M`.
* `TauCeti.reflectRep_map_reflectArrow` and `TauCeti.reflectRep_map_reflectArrowOfNeOfNe`: the
  action of a reversed arrow, by a coordinate projection out of the kernel, and of an arrow away
  from `i`, unchanged.
* `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor_obj`: the functor sends `M` to `TauCeti.reflectRep M`, so the whole
  `reflectRep` interface computes its objects.
* `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor_map_app_self_apply` and
  `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor_map_app_of_ne`: the action of reflection on morphisms.
* `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor_additive`: the reflection functor is additive.
* `TauCeti.dimVector_reflectRep_of_ne` and `TauCeti.dimVector_reflectRep_self_add`: the dimension
  vector of `C⁺ᵢ M`, away from `i` and at `i`.
* `TauCeti.dimVector_reflectRep`: `dim (C⁺ᵢ M) = sᵢ (dim M)` when the summing map is surjective.
* `TauCeti.incomingSum_not_surjective`: that surjectivity fails for a representation concentrated
  at `i` with nontrivial space there, and `TauCeti.subsingleton_reflectRep_obj_self`: the reflected
  space at `i` vanishes under the same source-vanishing hypothesis. Together they describe the
  vertex simple `Sᵢ`, the boundary case of the previous result.
* `TauCeti.forall_subsingleton_reflectRep_obj` and `TauCeti.isZero_reflectRep`: a representation
  concentrated at the sink reflects to the zero representation, the same boundary case read at
  every vertex and on the whole reflection.
* `TauCeti.finiteDimensional_reflectRep_obj`: reflection preserves finite-dimensionality of the
  vertex spaces.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_iso_of_isZero_away_of_linearEquiv` and
  `TauCeti.nonempty_iso_of_dimVector_eq_of_forall_subsingleton`: two representations concentrated
  at the same sink are isomorphic as soon as their vertex spaces there are, respectively as soon
  as their dimension vectors agree.
## Implementation notes

The vertex spaces branch on equality with `i`, so they are written with an `if` and decided
classically; no `DecidableEq Q` instance therefore appears in the interface of the construction,
exactly as for `TauCeti.simpleRep`. Only the statements naming `TauCeti.vertexPreReflection` assume
`DecidableEq Q`, because `Pi.single` needs one.

The vertex spaces, the prefunctor that `TauCeti.reflectRep` lifts, and the kernel maps underlying
the action on morphisms are private. The `reflectRep_obj_*`, `reflectRep_map_*`,
`reflectionFunctor_obj`, and `reflectionFunctor_map_app_*` theorems provide the interface
downstream files should use. The body of `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor` is not exposed outside this
module, so `reflectionFunctor_obj` cannot be proved by `rfl` where it is stated; it restates a
private unfolding lemma. A vertex space of a functor object is therefore computed by
`reflectionFunctor_obj` followed by the matching `reflectRep_obj_*` result, and that composite is
exactly the transport appearing in the `reflectionFunctor_map_app_*` statements.

The arrows of `TauCeti.Quiver.Reflect Q i` are given by `TauCeti.Quiver.reflectHom`, which is
again an `if` on equality with `i`, so an arrow of the reflected quiver is a *cast* of an arrow of
`Q`: `TauCeti.Quiver.reflectArrow` and `TauCeti.Quiver.reflectArrowOfNeOfNe` name the two casts, and
the computation rules for the action are stated on them. Both branches at `i` that a general vertex
would allow are impossible at a sink -- the reflected quiver has no arrow into `i` and `i` carries
no loop -- and the definition discharges them from `TauCeti.Quiver.IsSink`.

The universes are constrained the least the construction allows: the vertex spaces of `M` are
taken in `max v w x` for the vertex universe `v`, the arrow universe `w` and an arbitrary `x`,
because the reflected space at `i` is cut out of a product indexed by the arrows into `i`, which
lives in `max v w` together with the vertex spaces. The universe of the field is unconstrained.

A vertex `i : Q` is used below as an object of the free category `CategoryTheory.Paths Q`, which
is `Q` itself only by unfolding a semireducible definition; as in the neighbouring files, the
`CategoryTheory.Paths.of` annotations record that identification where a proof needs it.
