# The reflection functor is fully faithful where the incoming sum is onto

The Bernstein-Gelfand-Ponomarev reflection `C⁺ᵢ` at a sink `i` replaces the vertex space `Mᵢ` by
the kernel of the sum `TauCeti.incomingSum` of the arrows into `i`. It annihilates the vertex
simple `Sᵢ`, so it cannot be an equivalence; what it *is*, is fully faithful on the representations
whose incoming sum at `i` is onto. This file proves that: whenever the sum of the arrows into `i`
is onto for `M`, the map `(M ⟶ N) → (C⁺ᵢ M ⟶ C⁺ᵢ N)` supplied by `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor` is a
bijection. Only the source `M` needs the hypothesis; the target `N` is arbitrary.

Surjectivity of the incoming sum is the hypothesis throughout; it is not equivalent to avoiding
`Sᵢ`. It is `TauCeti.incomingSum_surjective_of_indecomposable` that ties the two together, and only
for an *indecomposable* `M`: such an `M` has its incoming sum at `i` onto as soon as it is not
isomorphic to `Sᵢ`. So the vertex simple names the exceptional case only among indecomposables, and
that is the only place below where it is mentioned.

Both halves are elementary once the incoming sum is available. **Faithfulness** is the surjectivity
of that sum: a morphism reflecting to zero has vanishing components away from `i`, hence, by
`TauCeti.incomingSum_naturality`, its component at `i` kills the range of the incoming sum, which
is everything. **Fullness** is the first isomorphism theorem: a morphism `θ` of the reflected
representations carries the kernel at `i` for `M` into the kernel for `N`, so the composite
`⨁_{a : b ⟶ i} M_b → ⨁_{a : b ⟶ i} N_b → Nᵢ` factors through the incoming sum of `M`, and the
resulting map `Mᵢ → Nᵢ` completes the components of `θ` away from `i` to a morphism `M ⟶ N`
reflecting back to `θ`.

The consequence is the second milestone of the reflection-functor route to Gabriel's theorem:
**reflection at a sink preserves indecomposability**. The reflection functor is additive, so a
bijection on endomorphisms matches idempotents with idempotents; an indecomposable `M` other than
`Sᵢ` therefore reflects to an indecomposable representation of the reflected quiver. No
finite-dimensionality is needed for that. It is needed for the other half of the induction step:
`TauCeti.dimVector_reflectRep_of_indecomposable` computes the dimension vector of the reflection as
`sᵢ · dim M` when the vertex spaces at the sources of the arrows into `i` are finite-dimensional.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor_map_injective`, `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor_map_surjective` and
  `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor_map_bijective`: **the reflection functor at a sink is fully faithful**
  on the representations whose incoming sum there is onto.
* `TauCeti.nonempty_iso_of_nonempty_iso_reflectRep`: **the reflection functor at a sink reflects
  isomorphisms** between representations whose incoming sums there are onto.
* `TauCeti.indecomposable_reflectRep`: **reflection at a sink preserves indecomposability**, under
  the same hypothesis.
* `TauCeti.indecomposable_reflectRep_of_not_nonempty_iso_simpleRep`: the same statement with the
  hypothesis discharged, for an indecomposable representation other than the vertex simple `Sᵢ`.

## Implementation notes

The reflection functor's object `(reflectionFunctor i hi).obj M` is only *propositionally* equal to
`TauCeti.reflectRep M hi`, because the body of the functor is not exposed outside the module
defining it. The statements below therefore speak of the functor's map, whose type mentions only
the functor, and the vertex spaces of its objects are named by the two private transports
`reflectObj_self` and `reflectObj_of_ne`, which are exactly the composites appearing in
`TauCeti.reflectionFunctor_map_app_self_apply` and `TauCeti.reflectionFunctor_map_app_of_ne`.
Proof irrelevance makes them interchangeable with the transports written inline there.

As in the neighbouring files, a vertex `i : Q` is used both as an object of `CategoryTheory.Paths`
and as a vertex of `TauCeti.Quiver.Reflect Q i`, identifications that hold only by unfolding
semireducible definitions. Goals mentioning both are therefore not type-correct at the transparency
`rw` and `simp` build motives with, so every step that strips a conjugation by `eqToHom` is
factored through the general transport lemmas in `TauCeti.CategoryTheory.EqToHom`, which `subst`
the object equalities away before doing anything.

The linear section of the incoming sum used to build the preimage exists because a vector space is
projective; the private `sinkSection` is a choice of one. Nothing downstream depends on which
section is chosen: the private `homSink_incomingSum` pins the resulting map on the whole of `Mᵢ`,
and it is the only property of that map the proofs use.
