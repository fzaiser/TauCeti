# The constituents of a restriction to a normal subgroup form one orbit

Let `N` be a normal subgroup of `G` and let `ρ` be an irreducible representation of `G` on `V`.
Given one minimal `N`-stable subspace to start from, restricting `ρ` to `N` breaks it into
irreducible constituents
(`TauCeti.Representation.isSemisimpleRepresentation_comp_subtype_of_isAtom`; for a
finite-dimensional `V` such a subspace always exists, and then no hypothesis is needed, which is
`TauCeti.Representation.isSemisimpleRepresentation_comp_subtype`).  This file identifies which
constituents occur: **they are the translates of any one of them**, up to isomorphism of
`N`-representations.  Equivalently, `G` permutes the isotypic components of the restriction
transitively.

The argument is short because the two halves it needs are already in place.  The translates
`TauCeti.Representation.conjSubrep ρ g σ` of a minimal `N`-stable subspace `σ` are again minimal
(`TauCeti.Representation.isAtom_conjSubrep_iff`) and they span
(`TauCeti.Representation.iSup_conjSubrep_eq_top`); and a simple submodule of a module spanned by
simple submodules is isomorphic to one of them (Mathlib's `Submodule.linearEquiv_of_sSup_eq_top`).
The spanning statement is needed in the lattice of `k[N]`-submodules of the restriction viewed as a
`k[N]`-module, where the isotypic machinery lives, rather than in the lattice of `k`-subspaces where
it is proved; that reading is `TauCeti.Representation.iSup_asSubmodule_conjSubrep_eq_top`, which
lives in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Induction/Clifford/Basic.lean` because the semisimplicity
proof there needs it too.

No invertibility of `Nat.card N` is used: irreducibility of the ambient representation replaces
Maschke's theorem throughout, exactly as in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Induction/Clifford/Basic.lean`.  The single-orbit statements need no
finiteness either; finiteness of `G` is assumed only by
`TauCeti.Representation.finite_isotypicComponents`, which counts the isotypic components through the
translates.  Finite-dimensionality of `V` is needed only to know that a minimal `N`-stable subspace
exists at all: each of the orbit and isotypic-component statements below takes such a subspace as a
hypothesis, except `TauCeti.Representation.exists_isAtom_forall_nonempty_linearEquiv_conjSubrep`,
the packaged form of the theorem, which assumes finite-dimensionality and produces one.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.Representation.exists_nonempty_linearEquiv_conjSubrep`: **Clifford's theorem, single
  orbit form.** Any two minimal `N`-stable subspaces of an irreducible representation are
  translates of one another, up to isomorphism of `N`-representations.
* `TauCeti.Representation.exists_isAtom_forall_nonempty_linearEquiv_conjSubrep`: the same statement
  packaged for a finite-dimensional irreducible representation, where the minimal subspace to
  translate is produced rather than assumed.
* `TauCeti.Representation.isotypicComponents_eq_range`: the isotypic components of the restriction
  are exactly the components of the translates of a given minimal `N`-stable subspace, so `G` acts
  transitively on them; `Representation.conjSubrepIsotypicComponent` packages each such
  component, and `TauCeti.Representation.finite_isotypicComponents` reads off from the same
  hypothesis that there are finitely many of them when `G` is finite.
* `TauCeti.Representation.isIsotypicOfType_asSubmodule_iff`: the restriction is isotypic exactly
  when every translate of one constituent is isomorphic to it — the case in which the inertia group
  of the constituent is all of `G`.

## Implementation notes

An `N`-constituent is presented as an atom of the lattice of `N`-subrepresentations, as in
`Basic.lean`, and "isomorphic as representations of `N`" is spelled as a `k[N]`-linear equivalence
of the associated submodules of `Representation.asModule (ρ.comp N.subtype)`.  That is what the
isotypic API of `Mathlib/RingTheory/SimpleModule/Isotypic.lean` speaks, and it is the same relation
as an isomorphism of the subrepresentations, transported along
`Subrepresentation.subrepresentationSubmoduleOrderIso`.  That an atom of the one lattice is a simple
module in the other is `Subrepresentation.isSimpleModule_asSubmodule_iff`, in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Subrepresentation.lean`; it uses neither normality nor irreducibility.
Reading the translate through `TauCeti.Representation.conjSubrepEquiv` turns each statement below
into the classical one about the conjugate representation `{}^g V`.

## References

This file proves the **single-orbit** half of the **Clifford's theorem** milestone of Layer 5 of
`TauCetiRoadmap/RepresentationTheory/InductionRestriction/README.md`: "its irreducible
`N`-constituents form a single `G`-orbit".  That the constituents share one multiplicity is the
other half, proved in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Induction/Clifford/Multiplicity.lean` from the
single-orbit statements below.  What remains of the milestone is the packaged decomposition
`Res_N W ≅ e · ⨁ᵢ {}^{gᵢ} V` indexed by a transversal of the inertia group, which is not proved
here.

The mathematics is the classical argument of C. W. Curtis and I. Reiner, *Representation Theory of
Finite Groups and Associative Algebras*, §49.
