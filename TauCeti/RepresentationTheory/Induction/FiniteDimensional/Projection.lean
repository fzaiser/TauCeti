# The projection formula on finite-dimensional representations

For a finite-index subgroup `S ≤ G` over a field `k`, this file specializes the projection formula
`TauCeti.indProjection` of `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Induction/Projection.lean` to
finite-dimensional representations, as

`Ind_S^G (A ⊗ Res_S^G B) ≅ (Ind_S^G A) ⊗ B`  in  `FDRep k G`.

The forgetful functor `forget₂ (FDRep k G) (Rep k G)` is fully faithful, so the isomorphism is
obtained as the preimage of its `Rep k G` counterpart, conjugated by the comparison
`TauCeti.indFDRepForgetIso` between the small carrier chosen by `TauCeti.indFDRep` and Mathlib's.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.indFDRepProjection`: the projection formula in `FDRep k G` for a finite-index subgroup.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.forget₂_map_indFDRepProjection_hom`: what `TauCeti.indFDRepProjection` is, read through
  the forgetful functor.

## Implementation notes

The subgroup has finite index because that is what keeps an induced representation
finite-dimensional. The ambient group is confined to the universe of `k` by the proof route
through the `Rep`-level `TauCeti.indProjection`, not by the statement: `FDRep k G` is monoidal for
`G` in any universe, so both sides of the isomorphism elaborate with `G` free. Lifting the
restriction would mean rebuilding the isomorphism at the universe-polymorphic
`Representation.Equiv` level, which needs a tensor-congruence for `Representation.Equiv` that the
library does not have.

`Ind_S^G (A ⊗ Res_S^G B) ≅ (Ind_S^G A) ⊗ B` in `FDRep k G`.

On isomorphism classes this becomes the statement that induction is a homomorphism of modules over
the representation ring, `TauCeti.repRingInd_mul_repRingRes`. -/
