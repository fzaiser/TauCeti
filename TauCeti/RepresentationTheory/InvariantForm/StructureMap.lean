# Structure maps and invariant bilinear forms, against a fixed invariant Hermitian form

An invariant *bilinear* form on an irreducible complex representation is strictly weaker than a
structure map.  Together with a positive definite invariant *Hermitian* form `H`, however, it
produces one: this file builds a conjugate-linear equivariant map of `V` out of the two forms, and
goes back again, so that against a fixed `H` one exists exactly when the other does.

Which structure map comes out is decided by the **flip rule** of the bilinear form.  Writing
`B x y = ε * B y x` -- with `ε = 1` for a symmetric form and `ε = -1` for an alternating one -- the
map `J` produced squares to `ε`:

* a symmetric `B` gives a conjugate-linear involution, a `Representation.IsRealStructure`,
  whose real points are a real form;
* an alternating `B` gives a conjugate-linear `J` with `J (J x) = -x`, a
  `Representation.IsQuaternionicStructure`, whose fixed points are only `0`.

Both cases are proved once here, for a real sign `ε` with `ε * ε = 1`, and specialized twice.

Comparing the two forms produces a conjugate-linear map `J` of `V` determined by
`H (J x) y = B x y`.  It exists because `H`, read as a map `V → V*`, is injective by definiteness
and hence bijective -- as an `ℝ`-linear map between two spaces of the same finite real dimension --
so it can be inverted on the `ℂ`-linear map `x ↦ B x`.  Invariance of both forms makes `J` commute
with the action, so `J ∘ J` is a `ℂ`-linear self-intertwiner, and Schur's lemma over the
algebraically closed `ℂ` forces `J ∘ J = c • id`.  The flip rule of `B` and the Hermitian symmetry
of `H` then evaluate `c`:

`H (J x) (J x) = B x (J x) = ε * B (J x) x = ε * H (J (J x)) x = ε * conj c * H x x`,

so `ε * c` is the ratio of two positive reals.  Rescaling `J` by the inverse square root of that
ratio -- a *real* scalar, so conjugate-linearity survives -- makes `J ∘ J` equal to `ε`: a real
structure when `ε = 1`, a quaternionic one when `ε = -1`.

Only the two forms are needed, so nothing here asks for a finite group -- nor even for a group,
since a definite invariant Hermitian form on a finite-dimensional space already makes each action
map bijective, which is all the equivariance argument would use an inverse for.  Producing the
invariant Hermitian form is where finiteness enters, in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/InvariantForm/Hermitian.lean`, and the Frobenius-Schur criteria this
feeds are in `TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/CharacterTable/FrobeniusSchur/Realizability.lean` and
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Compact/FrobeniusSchur/StructureMap.lean`.

The **converse** passage, from a structure map `K` back to an invariant bilinear form, is the
second half of the file, and it needs neither irreducibility nor finite dimensionality.  The naive
guess `B x y = H (K x) y` is bilinear, invariant and nondegenerate for free, but it obeys a flip
rule only if `H` is compatible with `K` in the sense `H (K x) (K y) = conj (H x y)`, which an
arbitrary invariant `H` need not be.  Replacing `H` by the **balanced** form
`LinearMap.balance H K x y = H x y + conj (H (K x) (K y))` of
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Complex/SesquilinearForm.lean` -- still invariant, Hermitian and positive
definite, since `K` is bijective -- makes it compatible, and then `B x y = H (K x) y` flips by the
sign that `K ∘ K` carries: symmetric for a real structure, alternating for a quaternionic one.
Against a fixed `H` the two directions assemble into the existence criteria
`Representation.exists_isRealStructure_iff` and
`Representation.exists_isQuaternionicStructure_iff`, which are what turn the Frobenius-Schur values
`1` and `-1` into structure maps whenever a positive definite invariant Hermitian form is
available -- by Haar averaging for a compact group as much as by summation for a finite one.

## Main results

* `Representation.exists_isRealStructure_of_isInvariantForm_of_isInvariantSesqForm`: **an
  irreducible representation carrying a nondegenerate invariant symmetric form and a nonnegative
  invariant Hermitian form that is definite off the origin has a real structure.**
* `Representation.exists_isQuaternionicStructure_of_isInvariantForm_of_isInvariantSesqForm`: **the
  same with an alternating form in place of a symmetric one produces a quaternionic structure.**
* `Representation.exists_isInvariantForm_isSymm_nondegenerate_of_isRealStructure`: **a real
  structure, together with a positive definite invariant Hermitian form, produces a nondegenerate
  invariant symmetric form.**
* `Representation.exists_isInvariantForm_isAlt_nondegenerate_of_isQuaternionicStructure`: **a
  quaternionic structure produces a nondegenerate invariant alternating form the same way.**
* `Representation.isInvariantSesqForm_balance`: **balancing an invariant sesquilinear form
  against an equivariant map leaves it invariant**, which is what makes the balanced form of
  `TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/Complex/SesquilinearForm.lean` usable on a representation.
* `Representation.exists_isRealStructure_iff` and
  `Representation.exists_isQuaternionicStructure_iff`: against a positive definite invariant
  Hermitian form, an irreducible finite-dimensional representation has a real, respectively a
  quaternionic, structure exactly when it carries a nondegenerate invariant symmetric,
  respectively alternating, form.

## Implementation notes

The two structure-map predicates are defined away from this file, so that stating one costs none of
the machinery used to produce it: `Representation.IsRealStructure` in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/RealForm.lean`, beside the real-form theory that consumes it, and
`Representation.IsQuaternionicStructure` in
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/QuaternionicStructure.lean`, on its own -- nothing of that real-form
theory attaches to it, since the fixed points of a `J` with `J (J v) = -v` are `0`.

/-- **The balanced form of an invariant sesquilinear form against an equivariant map is
invariant.**  Both summands of `LinearMap.balance H K` are, the second because `K` commutes with
the action.  This is the only interaction between balancing and invariance that the passage from a
structure map to an invariant bilinear form uses. -/

/-- **A structure map produces a nondegenerate invariant bilinear form flipping by the sign of its
square.**  Balancing the given invariant Hermitian form `H` against the structure map `K` makes it
satisfy `H (K x) (K y) = conj (H x y)`, and then `B x y = H (K x) y` is a bilinear form -- the two
conjugations, one from `K` and one from the first argument of `H`, cancel -- which is invariant
because both `H` and `K` are, obeys the flip rule `B x y = ε * B y x` by that compatibility, and is
nondegenerate because `H` is definite and `K` is injective.

Neither irreducibility nor finite dimensionality is used: this is the elementary direction of the
correspondence. -/
