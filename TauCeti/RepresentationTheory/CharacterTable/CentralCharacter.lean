# The central character of an irreducible representation

The centre of `k[G]` acts on an irreducible representation by scalars: a central element acts by an
intertwiner, and Schur's lemma over an algebraically closed field leaves only scalars. Recording
those scalars is the **central character** `ωᵪ : Z(k[G]) →ₐ[k] k` of the representation, the
general construction `TauCeti.centralCharacter` read on `ρ.asModule`.

Its values on the class sums are the character-theoretic content: taking traces in
`ρ(K_C) = ωᵪ(K_C) · id` turns the defining scalar identity into `ωᵪ(K_C) · χ(1) = |C| · χ(g)` for
any `g` in the class `C`. That identity is stated here without division, so that it holds over
every algebraically closed field; dividing by the degree `χ(1)` needs it to be invertible, which it
is in characteristic zero.

Because the class sums are integral over `ℤ` and an algebra homomorphism preserves integrality,
every value `ωᵪ(K_C)` is an algebraic integer. This is the input to the divisibility `χ(1) ∣ |G|`
and to the Dixon-Schneider algorithm, where the row `C ↦ ωᵪ(K_C)` is a common left eigenrow of the
class-multiplication matrices; that eigenrow property holds of any algebra homomorphism out of the
centre, and is `TauCeti.isClassEigenrow_classSumRow` applied to a central character.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Representation.centralCharacter`: the central character of an irreducible
  representation, a `k`-algebra homomorphism out of the centre of the group algebra.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.Representation.asAlgebraHom_center_apply`: a central element of the group algebra
  acts on the representation as the scalar its central character records, and
  `TauCeti.Representation.centralCharacter_eq_of_ne_zero_of_asAlgebraHom_apply_eq`: that scalar is
  the only one doing so at a single nonzero vector.
* `TauCeti.Representation.centralCharacter_classSumCenter_mul_character_one`: the class-sum
  identity `ωᵪ(K_C) · χ(1) = |C| · χ(g)`, in its division-free form, with
  `TauCeti.Representation.centralCharacter_classSumCenter` the quotient form for an invertible
  degree.
* `TauCeti.Representation.centralCharacter_eq_of_equiv`: equivalent irreducible representations
  have the same central character.
* `TauCeti.Representation.isIntegral_centralCharacter_classSumCenter`: the values of the central
  character on the class sums are algebraic integers.
* `TauCeti.Representation.centralCharacter_trivial_classSumCenter`: the worked case of the trivial
  representation, where the value on a class sum is the size of the class.

## Implementation notes

These declarations live in `TauCeti.Representation`, not in the root `Representation` namespace, so
dot notation on a representation does not reach them: they are applied as `centralCharacter ρ`.

/-- The **central character** of an irreducible representation: the algebra homomorphism recording
the scalar by which each central element of the group algebra acts.

An irreducible representation is a simple `k[G]`-module, so this is `TauCeti.centralCharacter` for
the algebra `k[G]`; the roadmap writes it `ωᵪ`. -/

commutes with the action of the group algebra, so it carries the scalar action of the centre on one
to the scalar action on the other; a nonzero vector then forces the two scalars to agree. -/

value on `C`.

This is the identity `ωᵪ(K_C) = |C| · χ(g) / χ(1)` of the roadmap, stated so that no invertibility

section Trivial

variable (k G) [Fintype G] [DecidableEq G]

/-- The central character of the trivial representation on the base field sends the class sum of
`C` to the size of `C`: every group element acts by the identity there, so a class sum acts by the
number of its terms.

This pins the normalization of `TauCeti.Representation.centralCharacter`. It is derived from
`TauCeti.Representation.centralCharacter_classSumCenter_mul_character_one` as the case `χ = 1`,
where both the degree and the character value on the class are `1`.

This is the simp normal form of the value: the central character of the trivial representation on a
class sum is evaluated to the size of the class. -/
