# Smooth discrete topological representations

An object `X : TopRep R G` carries one continuous operator `X.ρ g` per group element, and nothing
in that data forces the assignment `g ↦ X.ρ g` to be continuous in the group variable. So an
object whose underlying module happens to be discrete can still have non-open point stabilizers,
and there is no dictionary between all of `TopRep R G` and the discrete `G`-modules of Mathlib's
unbundled classes.

This file cuts out the subcategory where such a dictionary does exist. `TauCeti.IsSmoothDiscrete`
says that the underlying module is discrete and that every set `{g | X.ρ g x = x}` is open, which
for a discrete module over a topological *group* is exactly continuity of the action;
`TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule` turns a discrete `G`-module into an object of `TopRep R G`; and on the
discrete `G`-modules whose `G`-action is continuous — not on all of them — the two translations are
shown to be mutually inverse, both on objects and on morphisms.

The construction `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule` itself is available for *every* discrete `G`-module,
since a discrete module makes each operator continuous whatever the action does in the group
variable. It is only its *smoothness* that needs `ContinuousSMul G M`, and that hypothesis cannot
be dropped: `TauCeti.not_isSmoothDiscrete_ofDiscreteModule_units_zmod` exhibits a discrete module
with a discontinuous action whose object is discrete but not smooth. So the source side of the
dictionary is the discrete `G`-modules with continuous `G`-action, and the image of the
unrestricted construction is larger than the smooth discrete subcategory.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule`: a discrete `G`-module as an object of `TopRep R G`.
* `TauCeti.IsSmoothDiscrete`: the objects of `TopRep R G` whose underlying module is discrete and
  whose point stabilizers are open.
* `TopRep.distribMulAction`: the `G`-action on the underlying module of an object of
  `TopRep R G`, read off from its operators.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModuleMap`: a `G`-equivariant `R`-linear map of discrete modules as a
  morphism of `TopRep R G`.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModulePair`: a compatible pair `(φ : H →* G, f : M →ₗ[R] N)` as the morphism
  `TopRep.res φ (ofDiscreteModule R G M) ⟶ ofDiscreteModule R H N` that
  `ContinuousCohomology.map` consumes.
* `TauCeti.SmoothDiscreteTopRep`, `TauCeti.smoothDiscreteι`: the smooth discrete objects as a full
  subcategory of `TopRep R G`, and its inclusion functor.
* `TauCeti.DiscreteRep`: the discrete `G`-modules with continuous `G`-action as a category, the
  source side of the dictionary in bundled form; its morphisms are Mathlib's
  `Representation.IntertwiningMap`s.
* `TauCeti.toSmoothDiscrete`, `TauCeti.ofSmoothDiscrete`: the two translations as functors.
* `TauCeti.smoothDiscreteResFunctor`: restriction to a subgroup as a functor between the smooth
  discrete subcategories.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isSmoothDiscrete_iff_continuousSMul`: for a topological group, smoothness of a discrete
  object is continuity of the action map `G × X.V → X.V`.
* `TauCeti.isSmoothDiscrete_iff_discreteTopology_and_isContinuous`: the predicate is Mathlib's
  `Action.IsContinuous` together with discreteness, read on `Action (TopModuleCat R) G` through
  `TopRep.toActionTopModFunc`, so the subcategory below is Mathlib's `DiscreteContAction` carried
  across `TopRep.TopRepEquivActionTop` rather than a second notion.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule_isSmoothDiscrete`: a discrete `G`-module with continuous `G`-action
  lands in the subcategory.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule_eq_self`: conversely, a discrete object *is* the image of its own
  underlying module.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModuleHomAddEquiv`: morphisms between objects in the image are exactly the
  `G`-equivariant `R`-linear maps.
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModulePair_eq_of_hom_apply`: the compatible pair is the only morphism with its
  underlying map, which is how statements phrased with it are specialised.
* `TauCeti.res_ofDiscreteModule`: the dictionary commutes with restriction to a subgroup, on the
  nose.
* `TauCeti.IsSmoothDiscrete.res`: smoothness is inherited by restriction along a continuous
  homomorphism.
* `TauCeti.discreteRepEquivSmoothTopRep`: the two translations are an equivalence of categories
  between `TauCeti.DiscreteRep R G` and `TauCeti.SmoothDiscreteTopRep R G`.
* `TauCeti.not_isSmoothDiscrete_ofDiscreteModule_units_zmod`: a discrete object that is not
  smooth, so the subcategory is proper and the continuity hypothesis above is needed.

## Roadmap

This serves Layer 1 of the human-authored roadmap at `TauCetiRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology/README.md`,
whose "smooth discrete objects" and "the categorical dictionary" bullets it addresses. What is
delivered here is the predicate `TauCeti.IsSmoothDiscrete`, its closure under restriction, and the
dictionary in both directions up to the equivalence of categories; the closure of the smooth
discrete objects under finite products, subobjects and quotients, which the first of those bullets
also asks for, is not yet statable, because Mathlib's `TopRep` carries no limit, subobject or
quotient API to state it against.

The *names* below follow the human-authored
`TauCetiRoadmap/ProfiniteCohomology/Suggested.lean`, which fixes `TauCeti.IsSmoothDiscrete` and its
two fields, `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule`, `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule_isSmoothDiscrete`,
`TauCeti.ofDiscreteModuleMap`, `TauCeti.SmoothDiscreteTopRep`, `TauCeti.smoothDiscreteι`,
`TauCeti.DiscreteRep`, `TauCeti.toSmoothDiscrete`, `TauCeti.ofSmoothDiscrete` and
`TauCeti.discreteRepEquivSmoothTopRep`. The signatures and the field list deviate from it in four
places, each deliberately:

* the coefficient ring is an arbitrary topological ring `R` and the group is only a `Monoid`
  wherever the proofs allow, rather than `ℤ` and a topological group throughout;
* `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule` takes `R` and `G` explicitly, since neither is determined by the
  module `M` alone;
* `TauCeti.DiscreteRep` names its discreteness field `discreteTopology`, after the class it
  carries, and adds a field `continuousSMulRing` for `ContinuousSMul R V`, without which the
  underlying module is not an object of `TopModuleCat R` and `TauCeti.ofDiscreteModule` does not
  apply;
* morphisms of `TauCeti.DiscreteRep` are Mathlib's `Representation.IntertwiningMap`s rather than a
  new structure, and they drop the `cont` field the roadmap lists, continuity being automatic on
  discrete modules.

The carrier `TopRep` and its functoriality are Mathlib's, and are consumed rather than restated.
