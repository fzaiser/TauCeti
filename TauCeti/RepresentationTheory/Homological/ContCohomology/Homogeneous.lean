# The homogeneous form of a low-degree cochain

An inhomogeneous `n`-cochain `f` of `G` with values in `M` has a homogeneous partner, the
`G`-equivariant function of `n + 1` group elements

```text
homogeneous1 f h₀ h₁ = h₀ • f (h₀⁻¹ h₁),
homogeneous2 f h₀ h₁ h₂ = h₀ • f (h₀⁻¹ h₁, h₁⁻¹ h₂),
```

which this file builds in degrees one and two.  Equivariance
(`TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous2_smul`) is definitional bookkeeping; the point of the
homogeneous form is that the cocycle and coboundary conditions become *symmetric* in the
arguments.  A `2`-cocycle becomes the four-term relation
`TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous2_add_eq_add`, which says that the alternating sum over
dropping one of four points vanishes, and the coboundary of a `1`-cochain becomes the alternating
sum `TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous2_d1` of its own homogeneous form.

The reason to have the symmetric form is `TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous2_sub_comp`: for an
**arbitrary** map `v : G → G`, the values of a homogeneous `2`-cocycle at three points and at
their images under `v` differ by the alternating sum of the explicit two-variable comparison
function `TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneousHomotopy2`. This pointwise prism identity, applied to a
retraction of `G` onto a subgroup, is the comparison used in Shapiro's lemma. The comparison
function is itself a homogeneous (that is, equivariant) `1`-cochain only for those `g` with which
`v` commutes (`TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneousHomotopy2_smul`).

Mathlib's `Rep.diagonalHomEquiv` is the bundled `k`-linear version of the same correspondence, for
`Rep k G` and the diagonal resolution, and `ContinuousCohomology.homogeneousCochains` is the
all-degree homogeneous complex computing the canonical carrier.  Neither applies to the unbundled
`DistribMulAction`-valued continuous cochains of
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Homological/ContCohomology/LowDegree.lean`, which is what the
declarations below are stated for; nothing here builds a competing cohomology theory, only a
change of coordinates on the cochains of that file.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous1` and `TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous2`: the homogeneous
  forms of a `1`- and a `2`-cochain.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneousHomotopy2`: the two-variable comparison function between the
  values of a homogeneous `2`-cocycle at points and at their images under a self-map of `G`.

## Main statements

* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous2_add_eq_add`: the homogeneous four-term form of the
  `2`-cocycle identity.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous2_d1`: the homogeneous form of a `2`-coboundary is the
  alternating sum of the homogeneous form of its primitive.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.homogeneous2_sub_comp`: the values of a homogeneous `2`-cocycle at
  points and at their images under an arbitrary self-map of `G` differ by an alternating sum.
* `TauCeti.ContCohomology.continuous_homogeneous1` and
  `TauCeti.ContCohomology.continuous_homogeneous2`: continuity of the homogeneous forms read along
  continuous families of group elements.
