# Invariant bilinear forms on a representation

A bilinear form `B` on the space of a representation `ρ` of `G` is **invariant** when every `ρ g`
preserves it, `B (ρ g x) (ρ g y) = B x y`.  The invariant forms are a submodule of all bilinear
forms, and read as maps `V → V*` they are exactly the intertwiners from `ρ` to its dual
representation -- the concrete form of the statement that they are the `G`-invariants of a space
of bilinear forms.  Cutting the invariant forms down by symmetry, respectively by alternation,
gives two further submodules, and away from characteristic two they meet only in `0`.

On an **irreducible** representation the invariant forms are tightly constrained, and the three
constraints proved here are the ones the Frobenius-Schur trichotomy is read off from.  First, the
left radical of an invariant form is the kernel of an intertwiner out of an irreducible
representation, so a nonzero invariant form on one is nondegenerate.  Second, over an
algebraically closed field and in finite dimensions, Schur's lemma makes a nonzero invariant form
unique up to a scalar: the invariant forms are the line it spans.  Third -- and this is the
point -- the flip of an invariant form is invariant, so a nonzero invariant form is a scalar
multiple of its own flip; flipping twice squares the scalar to `1`, and the form is therefore
either symmetric or the negative of its flip.
Away from characteristic two the second alternative is exactly alternation, which gives the
orthogonal/symplectic dichotomy: an irreducible representation carries at most a line of invariant
forms, and -- in characteristic other than two -- any nonzero one on it is either symmetric or
alternating.

Nothing here needs a finite group, and almost nothing needs finite dimensions: invariance, and the
symmetric and alternating invariant forms with it, are defined for a representation of a monoid on
a module over a commutative semiring, and only the results that invoke Schur's lemma ask for an
algebraically closed field and a finite-dimensional space.  The `g⁻¹` in
`TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.apply_left`, and with it the comparison with the dual
representation, is what makes `G` a group.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm`: `B (ρ g x) (ρ g y) = B x y` for all `g`, `x`, `y`.
* `TauCeti.Representation.invariantForms`: the invariant forms, as a submodule of `BilinForm k V`.
* `TauCeti.Representation.symmetricInvariantForms` and
  `TauCeti.Representation.alternatingInvariantForms`: the invariant forms that are symmetric,
  respectively alternating.
* `TauCeti.Representation.invariantFormsEquivIntertwiningMapDual`: the invariant forms of `ρ` as
  the intertwiners from `ρ` to its dual.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Representation.isInvariantForm_iff_isIntertwiningMap`: a form is invariant exactly when
  it intertwines `ρ` with `ρ.dual`.
* `TauCeti.Representation.invariantForms_eq_invariants_linHom_dual`: the invariant forms are the
  invariants of `linHom ρ ρ.dual`.
* `TauCeti.Representation.symmetricInvariantForms_inf_alternatingInvariantForms`: away from
  characteristic two the symmetric and the alternating invariant forms meet only in `0`.
* `TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.nondegenerate` and
  `TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.nondegenerate_iff_ne_zero`: an invariant form on an
  irreducible representation is nondegenerate exactly when it is nonzero.
* `TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.exists_eq_smul`: over an algebraically closed field and
  in finite dimensions, an invariant form on an irreducible representation is a scalar multiple of
  any nonzero one.
* `TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.invariantForms_eq_span`: over an algebraically closed
  field and in finite dimensions, a nonzero invariant form on an irreducible representation spans
  all of them.
* `TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.flip_eq_or_flip_eq_neg`: in every characteristic, the
  flip of such a form is the form itself or its negative.
* `TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.isSymm_or_isAlt`: away from characteristic two -- the
  hypothesis `(2 : k) ≠ 0` -- such a form is symmetric or alternating.
* `TauCeti.Representation.exists_isSymm_or_exists_isAlt_or_invariantForms_eq_bot`: the case split
  that dichotomy gives, that an irreducible representation carries a nonzero invariant symmetric
  form, or a nonzero invariant alternating one, or no nonzero invariant form at all.

## Implementation notes

`TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm` is the statement that every `ρ g` is an isometry of the
form, `TauCeti.BilinForm.IsIsometry B (ρ g)`, so that the invariant forms of a representation and
the isometry group of a form are the same notion read two ways.  Its body is not exposed:
`TauCeti.Representation.isInvariantForm_iff_isIsometry` and
`TauCeti.Representation.isInvariantForm_iff` introduce its isometry and pointwise forms, while
`TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.isIsometry` and
`TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.apply` eliminate them, so nothing outside this file has to
unfold the definition.  The pointwise `iff` is deliberately not a `simp` lemma: unfolding
invariance into its quantified equation would take
`TauCeti.Representation.isInvariantForm_zero` and
`TauCeti.Representation.mem_invariantForms` out of simp-normal form, which the `simpNF` linter
rejects.  What the file adds around that pair is the two rewritings that are *not*
immediate -- moving a single `ρ g` across the form at the cost of an inverse
(`TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.apply_left`), and the identification with intertwiners
into the dual.  That identification is recorded twice: once unbundled as
`TauCeti.Representation.isInvariantForm_iff_isIntertwiningMap`, which is the shape the proofs
below use, and once as the linear equivalence
`TauCeti.Representation.invariantFormsEquivIntertwiningMapDual`, which is the shape a dimension
count of the invariant forms needs.  The equivalence is not built by hand: the invariant forms are
literally the invariants of `linHom ρ ρ.dual`
(`TauCeti.Representation.invariantForms_eq_invariants_linHom_dual`), so it is Mathlib's
`Representation.invariantsEquivIntertwiningMap` transported along that equality.  Mathlib's
`Representation.invariants` asks for a commutative ring and an additive group, which is why the two
declarations sit in a narrower section than the rest of the file; the additive group on the space
of maps `V → V*` is supplied explicitly, because a representation records only the additive monoid
and the elaborator does not solve for a group structure inducing a given one.  The equivalence is
not exposed,
so a downstream module uses it opaquely -- a dimension count goes through `LinearEquiv.finrank_eq`
and never looks at a value.  When a value is needed, the two `simp` lemmas
`TauCeti.Representation.invariantFormsEquivIntertwiningMapDual_apply_toLinearMap` and
`TauCeti.Representation.invariantFormsEquivIntertwiningMapDual_symm_apply_coe` are what identify
it: they say the equivalence moves a form and an intertwiner to each other unchanged.

That identification is also what controls the left radical: the form is an intertwiner out of an
irreducible representation, so `TauCeti.Representation.IsInvariantForm.ker_eq_bot` is Mathlib's
`Representation.IsIrreducible.injective_or_eq_zero` rather than a hand-built subrepresentation
argument.  Schur's lemma enters through Mathlib's
`Representation.IsIrreducible.algebraMap_intertwiningMap_bijective_of_isAlgClosed`, the same
theorem that `TauCeti.ContRepresentation.exists_eq_smul_one_of_irreducible` rests on for a
continuous representation.
