# The Riemann bilinear relations in weight one

An effective Hodge structure of weight one has only the two Hodge components `H^{1,0}` and
`H^{0,1}`, and its Weil operator `C` restricts to a complex structure on the real form of its
lattice. For such a structure the Hodge–Riemann relations become the two classical **Riemann
bilinear relations**, which speak only about real vectors: a nondegenerate alternating integral
form `Q` polarizes the structure as soon as

* `Q (C x) (C y) = Q x y` for all real `x` and `y`, and
* `0 < Q (C x) x` for every nonzero real `x`.

Both relations are also necessary — the first is
`TauCeti.Hodge.IsPolarization.isOrthogonal_weilOperator` read on real vectors, and the second is
`TauCeti.Hodge.IsPolarization.integralFormBaseChange_weilOperator_self_pos`, which holds in
arbitrary weight — so among nondegenerate alternating forms the two relations characterize the
polarizing ones. This is the shape in which a Riemann form on a lattice with a complex structure
polarizes the weight-one Hodge structure it carries, as for the first cohomology of a complex
torus.

Effectivity is what makes the two relations sufficient, and it is not decoration. The operator `C`
acts on `H^{p,1-p}` by `i^{2p-1}`, so invariance of `Q` under `C` forces that component to be
orthogonal to `H^{p',1-p'}` only when `p` and `p'` have the same parity. For an effective structure
the sole orthogonality a polarization asks for is `H^{1,0}` against itself, a pair of equal — hence
equal-parity — degrees. A non-effective weight-one structure also has components `H^{p,1-p}` with
`p ∉ {0, 1}`, where the relations pair degrees of opposite parity, so it is not covered.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Hodge.isPolarization_of_weilOperator_invariant_on_realPoints_of_pos`: the Riemann
  bilinear relations polarize an effective weight-one Hodge structure.

The conventions are those pinned in `TauCeti.Hodge.IsPolarization`; the relations follow Voisin,
*Hodge Theory and Complex Algebraic Geometry I*, §7.1.2, and Peters–Steenbrink, *Mixed Hodge
Structures*, §2.

/-- The second Hodge–Riemann relation on `H^{1,0}`, from positivity on the real form. For `z` in
`H^{1,0}` the vector `v = z + conj z` is a nonzero real vector, and `Q (C v) v = 2 i Q z (conj z)`,
because `C` acts by `i` on `z` and by `-i` on `conj z` while `Q` kills both diagonal terms. -/

/-- **The Riemann bilinear relations polarize an effective weight-one Hodge structure.** Let `Q` be
a nondegenerate antisymmetric form on the lattice of an effective Hodge structure of weight one,
and let `C` be its Weil operator, a complex structure on the real form. If the complexification of
`Q` is invariant under `C` on real vectors, and is positive on the pair `(C x, x)` for every
nonzero real vector `x`, then `Q` polarizes the structure.

Invariance under `C` gives the first Hodge–Riemann relation: on `H^{1,0}` the operator `C` acts by
`i`, so invariance forces the form to vanish there, and in weight one that is the only relation to
check. Positivity on the real form gives the second: a nonzero class of `H^{1,0}` and its conjugate
add up to a nonzero real vector on which the hypothesis applies. -/
