# Strictness of a morphism of mixed Hodge structures

A morphism of mixed Hodge structures is **strict**: an element of the target that lies in a step
of a filtration *and* in the image of the morphism is already the image of an element of the
corresponding step of the source. Filtration-preserving maps are not strict in general — this is
the theorem that makes the category of mixed Hodge structures abelian — and the proof is Deligne's
bigrading.

Both filtrations are recovered from the bigrading `I^{p,q}`
(`TauCeti.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.WC_eq_iSup_deligneSplitting` and
`TauCeti.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.F_eq_iSup_deligneSplitting`) as suprema of the pieces over a set
of bidegrees, a morphism carries `I^{p,q}` into `I^{p,q}`
(`TauCeti.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.Hom.map_deligneSplitting_le`), and the pieces of the target are
independent. Strictness for both filtrations at once is then the lattice statement that in a
family `B ≤ A` with `A` independent, the sum of the `B` over *all* indices meets the sum of the `A`
over a set `S` of indices in exactly the sum of the `B` over `S`: an element of the intersection
has no component of the target's bigrading outside `S`, so the source element producing it may be
truncated to its own components in `S`.

The weight filtration is a rational datum, and its strictness is stated rationally. It descends
from the complex statement because `ℂ` is faithfully flat over `ℚ`, so an inclusion of rational
subspaces can be tested after complexification
(`TauCeti.Hodge.rationalToComplexSubmodule_le_iff`); only the trivial half of the compatibility of
complexification with intersections is needed.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.Hom.range_inf_iSup_deligneSplittingFamily_eq_map_iSup`:
  strictness against an arbitrary set of bidegrees.
* `TauCeti.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.Hom.range_inf_F_eq_map_F`: **strictness for the Hodge
  filtration**, `im f ∩ F'^p = f(F^p)`.
* `TauCeti.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.Hom.range_inf_WQ_eq_map_WQ`: **strictness for the weight
  filtration**, `im f ∩ W'_k = f(W_k)`, rationally.
* `TauCeti.Hodge.MixedHodgeStructure.Hom.range_inf_WC_eq_map_WC`: the complexification of the
  latter.

/-! ### The image of a morphism, bigraded -/

/-- The image of a morphism of mixed Hodge structures is the sum of the images of the bigrading
pieces of its source: the bigrading of the source spans. -/

  rw [← Submodule.map_iSup, source.iSup_deligneSplittingFamily_eq_top, Submodule.map_top]

/-- **Strictness against a set of bidegrees.** The image of a morphism meets the sum of the
target's bigrading pieces over the bidegrees satisfying `P` in exactly the image of the
corresponding sum for the source.

Both filtrations of a mixed Hodge structure are sums of bigrading pieces over such a set, so this
single statement carries every strictness assertion below. -/

/-! ### Strictness -/

/-- **Strictness of a morphism of mixed Hodge structures for the Hodge filtration.** A complex
vector lying both in the image of `f` and in the target's Hodge step `F^p` is the image of a
vector of the source's `F^p`.

The two filtration steps are the sums of the bigrading pieces of first index at least `p`, and `f`
respects the bigrading, so a preimage may be truncated to its components of first index at least
`p` without changing its image. -/

    ← source.F_eq_iSup_deligneSplitting p] using

filtration.** -/

    ← source.WC_eq_iSup_deligneSplitting k] using
    f.range_inf_iSup_deligneSplittingFamily_eq_map_iSup fun pq ↦ pq.1 + pq.2 ≤ k

/-- **Strictness of a morphism of mixed Hodge structures for the weight filtration.** A rational
vector lying both in the image of `f` and in the target's weight step `W_k` is the image of a
vector of the source's `W_k`.

The weight filtration is rational, so this is the form the milestone takes; it descends from the
complex statement because complexification of rational subspaces reflects inclusions. Only the
inclusion `(A ∩ B)_ℂ ≤ A_ℂ ∩ B_ℂ` is used, which is monotonicity. -/
