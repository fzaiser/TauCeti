# Smooth ambient isotopies

A `Diffeotopy J n M` is a `C^n` motion of a real manifold `M` through
self-diffeomorphisms, starting at the identity.  It is bundled by its level-preserving total
diffeomorphism of `I × M`: this makes invertibility in the time and space variables part of the
data and ensures that no unrelated choices of inverse maps are carried by the structure.

The time interval is Mathlib's `unitInterval`, with its manifold-with-boundary structure modelled
on `𝓡∂ 1`.  The total diffeomorphism is required to preserve the time coordinate.  Its slice at
each `t : I` is therefore a self-diffeomorphism of `M`; `Diffeotopy.timeSlice` packages that fact.
Diffeotopies coerce to their spatial component, so `Φ (t, x)` is the point of `M` reached from
`x` at time `t`.
Diffeotopies compose and invert, and forgetting smoothness gives the existing
`TauCeti.AmbientIsotopy`.

This supplies the smooth ambient-isotopy half of the geometric-topology roadmap's requirement
that isotopy notions be defined generally before they are specialized to knots.  The non-ambient
smooth isotopy of arbitrary maps is separate and is not defined here.  The specialization to
bundled smooth embeddings, used for geometric knot presentations, is in
`TauCeti.Geometry.Manifold.SmoothEmbedding.SmoothAmbientIsotopy.Basic`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.Diffeotopy`: a level-preserving diffeomorphism of `I × M` starting at the identity.
* `TauCeti.Diffeotopy.timeSlice`: the self-diffeomorphism of `M` at a fixed time.
* `TauCeti.Diffeotopy.final`: the self-diffeomorphism at time one.
* `TauCeti.Diffeotopy.refl`, `trans`, and `symm`: the constant, composite, and inverse
  diffeotopies.
* `TauCeti.Diffeotopy.toAmbientIsotopy`: forget smoothness to obtain a continuous ambient
  isotopy.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Diffeotopy.timeSlice_trans` and `timeSlice_symm`: time slices commute with composition
  and inversion.
* `TauCeti.Diffeotopy.final_trans` and `final_symm`: the corresponding calculus for final
  diffeomorphisms.
* `TauCeti.Diffeotopy.toAmbientIsotopy_final_apply`: forgetting smoothness preserves the final
  action.
