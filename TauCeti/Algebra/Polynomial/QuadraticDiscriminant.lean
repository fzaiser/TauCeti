# Separability and splitting criteria for quadratic polynomials

Mathlib's `Mathlib/Algebra/QuadraticDiscriminant.lean` works with the *equation*
`a x² + b x + c = 0` and relates its solutions to `discrim a b c = b² - 4 a c`. This file reads
those facts back as statements about the *polynomial* `C a * X ^ 2 + C b * X + C c`. Wherever a
statement mentions the discriminant it uses Mathlib's `discrim` rather than its expansion, so
that Mathlib's discriminant API applies to it directly; the two criteria phrased by a root or by
an Artin-Schreier condition mention no discriminant at all.

Over a field, with `a ≠ 0`:

* `Polynomial.separable_quadratic_iff_discrim_ne_zero`: separable exactly when `discrim a b c ≠ 0`;
* `Polynomial.splits_quadratic_iff_exists_root`: splits exactly when it has a root — the
  characteristic-free core the other two are read off from;
* `Polynomial.splits_quadratic_iff_isSquare`: away from characteristic two, splits exactly when
  `discrim a b c` is a square;
* `Polynomial.splits_quadratic_iff_exists_artinSchreier_of_two_eq_zero`: in characteristic two,
  where the discriminant degenerates to `b²` (`discrim_eq_sq_of_two_eq_zero`) and the square-class
  criterion says nothing, splits exactly when the
  Artin-Schreier invariant `a c / b²` lies in the image of `z ↦ z² + z`, written division-free.
  Here `b ≠ 0` is also required, which by `separable_quadratic_iff_discrim_ne_zero` is separability.

Three statements need neither a field nor `a ≠ 0`, and are stated over a commutative (semi)ring:
`Polynomial.derivative_quadratic`, computing the derivative as `2 a X + b`; the Bézout-type
`Polynomial.sq_derivative_quadratic_sub_mul_eq_C_discrim`, `(P')² - 4 a P = C (discrim a b c)`; and
its consequence `Polynomial.separable_quadratic_of_isUnit_discrim`, that the quadratic is separable
whenever its discriminant is a unit. Over a field that last statement is one direction of
`Polynomial.separable_quadratic_iff_discrim_ne_zero`, in every characteristic.

The two splitting criteria are consumed by the node-polynomial criteria of
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/EllipticCurve/NodePolynomial.lean`, which advance
`TauCetiRoadmap/EllipticCurves/README.md` §Layer 5 (twists): whether the node polynomial of a
multiplicative reduction splits over the residue field is exactly whether that reduction is split.

following this repository's convention for adapted material, the upstream authorship is credited
here rather than in the copyright header. Ported with the source's `@[expose]` dropped, and
without its companion `FLT/Mathlib/Algebra/Polynomial/Splits.lean`: that file's
`Splits.of_natDegree_le_two_of_isRoot` is superseded here by Mathlib's own
`Polynomial.Splits.of_natDegree_eq_two`, which the one consumer can use directly since it knows
the degree is exactly two.

/-- In characteristic two the discriminant degenerates to `b²`, since `4 = 0` kills the `a c`
term. This is why `splits_quadratic_iff_isSquare` says nothing there: `discrim a b c` is
automatically a square. -/

polynomial and its derivative. -/

`discrim a b c` is nonzero. This holds in every characteristic; contrast
`splits_quadratic_iff_isSquare`, which asks for the discriminant to be a square rather than
nonzero, and only away from characteristic two. The reverse direction needs neither a field nor
`a ≠ 0`: it is `separable_quadratic_of_isUnit_discrim`. -/
