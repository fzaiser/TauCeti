# Clearing a common power of `X` from a family of polynomials

Given a family of polynomials that is not identically zero, the least exponent occurring
with a nonzero coefficient across the family is the largest power of `X` dividing every member.
Dividing by that power leaves at least one polynomial with nonzero constant term. The family
may be infinite: the least exponent exists by well-ordering of the natural numbers.

This elementary polynomial result is used in three function-field linear-independence arguments:
the valuation criterion of Stichtenoth, Lemma 1.1.7 (`Place.OfValuationSubring`), the place-degree
bound of Proposition 1.1.15 (`Place.Degree`), and the bound on zeros counted with multiplicity
and degree of Proposition 1.3.3 (`Place.Zeros`).

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Polynomial.exists_common_X_pow_factor`: a family of polynomials, not all zero, is
  `X ^ m` times a family in which some member has nonzero constant term.
