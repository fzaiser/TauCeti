# Cohomological units for `A∞` algebras

A cohomological unit is a degree-zero cycle whose left and right binary products act as the
identity modulo boundaries.  Unlike a strict unit, its unit equations therefore hold only after
passing to the cohomology of the unary operation, and it places no restriction on higher
operations containing its chosen representative.

The characteristic API for a cohomological unit is stated both in terms of explicit boundaries and
as the two unit laws for the product `AInfinityAlgebra.cohomologyMul` on the total cohomology
module.  In particular, any two representatives of a cohomological unit determine the same class,
while every strict unit supplies a cohomological one.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.CohomologicalUnit`: a representative of a two-sided unit in
  cohomology.
* `TauCeti.AInfinityAlgebra.CohomologicallyUnital`: existence of such a representative.

-- Source: the `CohomologicalUnit` scaffold in `TauCetiRoadmap/DGAInfinity/Suggested.lean`, with
-- its cycle and boundary conditions restated against `cycles` and `boundaries`.
/-- A chain representative of a unit on the cohomology of an `A∞` algebra.

The representative is a degree-zero cycle.  Its binary products with every cycle differ from that
cycle by an explicit unary boundary, on both the left and the right.  These equations neither
select a strict chain-level unit nor constrain higher operations on tuples containing `e`. -/
