# The Frobenius of the doubled type-E6 minuscule carrier

`TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.groupScheme` is the explicit full-weight type-`E₆` carrier over `ℤ`
built from `V(ϖ₁) ⊕ V(ϖ₆)`, and `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.points A` realizes its `A`-valued
points as a subgroup of `GL₅₄(A)`. Over a commutative ring `A` of exponential characteristic `p`,
entrywise `p ^ k`-th powers are a homomorphism of value rings, so the carrier's functoriality
turns them into a group endomorphism of its points.

This file names that endomorphism `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.frobenius` and records its
characteristic equations:

```text
F (g)ᵢⱼ = gᵢⱼ ^ (p ^ k),
F (xᵢ(u)) = xᵢ(u ^ (p ^ k)),
F (t(s)) = t(s ^ (p ^ k)).
```

The zeroth iterate is the identity, exponents add under composition and multiply under taking
powers in the endomorphism monoid, and the fixed points are the points of the same carrier over
the Frobenius-fixed subring.

The `27`-dimensional carrier already carries a Frobenius, `TauCeti.E6Minuscule.frobenius`, and it
is the one the untwisted family `E₆(q)` is built from. What the doubled carrier adds is the index
set on which the `E₆` diagram symmetry acts, by
`TauCeti.DynkinType.e6DoubledMinusculeWeight_e6DoubledMinusculeGraphPerm`, whereas that symmetry
moves every minuscule weight off the twenty-seven-element table by
`TauCeti.DynkinType.e6MinusculeWeight_comp_graphPermE6_notMem_range`. A Steinberg map composing a
graph automorphism with a field Frobenius therefore needs the Frobenius of *this* carrier, which
is what is built here. The graph automorphism is built in a separate module, and no declaration
below mentions the diagram symmetry.

Nothing here asserts reductivity, maximality of the weight torus, an identification of the
carrier's root datum, or any finiteness or simplicity statement.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.frobenius`: the `p ^ k`-power Frobenius on the carrier's points.
* `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.coe_frobenius` and `coe_frobenius_apply`: its matrix and entrywise
  actions.
* `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.frobenius_eq_map`: it is the functorial map on points induced
  by the iterated Frobenius of the value ring.
* `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.frobenius_rootSubgroupPoints`: its action on every numbered
  simple-root subgroup.
* `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.frobenius_weightTorusPoints`: its action on the split weight torus.
* `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.frobenius_zero`, `frobenius_add` and `frobenius_pow`: its iteration
  laws.
* `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.frobenius_eq_self_iff` and
  `TauCeti.E6DoubledMinuscule.map_subtype_fixedSubgroup_frobenius_eq`: which points it fixes, and
  the identification of the fixed subgroup with the points over the Frobenius-fixed subring.

* The formal organization follows the carrier specializations

  `TauCeti.Algebra.Lie.SpecialLinear.StandardCarrier.Frobenius` and
  `TauCeti.Algebra.Lie.Symplectic.StandardCarrier.Frobenius`, and the power law follows
  `TauCeti.DynkinType.geckFrobenius_pow` in
  `TauCeti.LinearAlgebra.RootSystem.SimplyConnectedRootDatum.GeckLattice.Frobenius`. Every
  general fact used about entrywise Frobenius is consumed rather than reproved: the facts about
  the points cut out by a Hopf ideal from
  `TauCeti.Algebra.AlgebraicGroup.Frobenius.GeneralLinear`, and the entrywise Frobenius of a
  weight-torus matrix from
  `TauCeti.Algebra.Lie.UniversalEnveloping.Kostant.RootSubgroup.Scheme.ToralClosure.Frobenius`.

## Roadmap

This advances the target "points over an algebraically closed field as a group, functorially in
the field, so that a field endomorphism induces a group endomorphism of the points", whose "the
`q`-power Frobenius is the case a consumer asks for first", in Layer 9, "pinned
Chevalley--Demazure group schemes over `ℤ`", of `TauCetiRoadmap/ReductiveGroups/README.md`. Its
consumer is milestone L1, "ordinary and graph Steinberg maps", of
`TauCetiRoadmap/CFSGStatement/README.md`, whose Steinberg map for the twisted family `²E₆(q)` is
`γ₂ ∘ Frob_q` on the points of a carrier for the `E₆` diagram over an algebraic closure of
`ZMod p`; the identification of this carrier with the pinned simply connected Chevalley--Demazure
group that milestone requires remains pending.
