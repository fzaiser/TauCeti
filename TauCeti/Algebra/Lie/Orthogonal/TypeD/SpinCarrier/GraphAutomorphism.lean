# The graph automorphism of the full-weight type-D spin carrier

For `4 ≤ n`, `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.groupScheme` is the explicit full-weight Chevalley carrier
of type `Dₙ`, cut out inside `GL_(2^n)` over `ℤ` by the split spin representation and its exterior
coordinate lattice. The Dynkin diagram `Dₙ` carries the involution exchanging its two fork nodes,
`TauCeti.graphPermD`, and this file equips the carrier with the automorphism realizing it.

The datum the construction consumes is a lattice-preserving linear automorphism of the spin module
which intertwines the numbered Serre generators along that node exchange, acts monomially on the
chosen coordinate basis, and permutes the weights compatibly.
`TauCeti/RepresentationTheory/Spin/Polarization/TypeD/GraphAutomorphism.lean` already supplies the
first two: the graph operator, creation at the final coordinate minus annihilation at it, is the
spin action of a Clifford generator of a vector of norm `-1`, it preserves the coordinate lattice
in both directions, and it intertwines the numbered generators. What this file adds is the
remaining coordinate bookkeeping, and then the descent.

On the exterior basis vector indexed by a sign set `s` the graph operator acts by a single
coordinate move: it creates the final coordinate when `s` misses it and annihilates it when `s`
carries it, in both cases up to the shuffle sign that moves that coordinate to the front. So the
basis is permuted by the final-sign toggle `TauCeti.DynkinType.typeDSpinGraphPerm` and rescaled by
a sign, which is `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphBasisScale`. That toggle exchanges the two fork
coordinates of every spin weight, which is the weight compatibility. Both hypotheses in hand, the
numbered-symmetry construction of a Kostant toral closure descends the operator to
`TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAut`, an automorphism `γ` of the carrier with

```text
γ (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u),
```

on every Bourbaki-numbered raising and lowering root subgroup, `σ` the fork exchange, and with
`γ ^ 2 = 1`.

The graph operator itself squares to `-1`, so the signed permutation matrix
`TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAutMatrix` squares to the scalar `-1`: the two signs at a
graph-exchanged pair of coordinates multiply to `-1`, which is
`TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphBasisScale_graphBasisPerm_mul`. The automorphism of the carrier is
conjugation by that matrix, and `-1` is central, so conjugating twice is the identity whatever the
value ring.

Nothing here asserts that the carrier is reductive, that its weight torus is maximal, that it is
the spin group scheme or the pinned simply connected Chevalley--Demazure group scheme of type
`Dₙ`, or that any group mentioned is finite, perfect, or simple.

What this feeds is the graph-twisted family `²Dₙ(q)`, whose Steinberg endomorphism is `γ ∘ Frob_q`
for the `γ` built here and the `q`-power Frobenius of
`TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/Orthogonal/TypeD/SpinCarrier/Frobenius.lean`, on the very carrier
`TauCeti/GroupTheory/SpecificGroups/CFSG/TypeD.lean` attaches to the three families on a type-`D`
diagram. The type-`A` counterpart of this construction is
`TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/SpecialLinear/StandardCarrier/GraphAutomorphism.lean`, and the counterpart on
the Geck carrier is
`TauCeti/LinearAlgebra/RootSystem/SimplyConnectedRootDatum/GeckLattice/GraphAutomorphism.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphRootPerm`: the fork exchange on the numbered root generators.
* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphBasisPerm` and `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphBasisScale`: the
  permutation and the signs by which the graph operator acts on the spin coordinate basis.
* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAut`: the graph automorphism of the type-`Dₙ` spin carrier.
* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAutMatrix` and `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAutPoints`: the
  signed permutation matrix of the coordinate involution, and conjugation by it on the
  matrix-valued points of the carrier.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphOperator_latticeBasis`: the graph operator acts monomially on the
  spin coordinate basis.
* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.basisWeight_graphBasisPerm`: the coordinate involution is equivariant
  for the fork exchange of the Bourbaki nodes on the spin weights.
* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.rootSubgroup_comp_graphAut_hom` and
  `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAutPoints_rootSubgroupPoints`: the pinning equation
  `γ (x_i(u)) = x_{σ i}(u)`, on the carrier and on its matrix-valued points.
* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.weightTorus_comp_graphAut_hom` and
  `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAutPoints_weightTorusPoints`: the graph automorphism relabels the
  coordinates of the represented spin weight torus by the fork exchange.
* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.schemePointsMulEquiv_graphAut_comp_carrierι`: on every algebra-valued
  point of the carrier, the automorphism of the carrier is the conjugation that the automorphism on
  points performs, so the two are the same action.
* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAut_sq`,
  `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAut_hom_comp_self` and
  `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAutPoints_apply_apply`: the order relation `γ ^ 2 = 1`, in the
  automorphism group of the carrier, as a composition of scheme morphisms, and on points.
* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAutMatrix_mul_self`: the matrix implementing it squares to `-1`.
* `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.map_comp_graphAutPoints`: the automorphism on points is natural
  in the value ring, so in particular it commutes with the Frobenius of
  `TauCeti/Algebra/Lie/Orthogonal/TypeD/SpinCarrier/Frobenius.lean`.

On every algebra-valued point of the carrier, composing with

`TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAutMatrix`, which is what `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.graphAutPoints`
does by `TauCeti.TypeDSpinCarrier.coe_graphAutPoints`. So the automorphism of the carrier and the
