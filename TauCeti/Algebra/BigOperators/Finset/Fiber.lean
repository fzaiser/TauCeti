# Regrouping a finite sum by the fibres of a map

A sum over a finite type can be taken fibrewise along any map out of it: sum over the values the
map actually takes, and within each value over the indices sent there.

Mathlib's `Fintype.sum_fiberwise` says this with the outer sum ranging over the whole codomain,
which needs the codomain finite. The version here indexes the outer sum by the *image* instead,
so it applies to a map into an arbitrary type — the situation whenever the codomain is a
quotient or a subtype with no finiteness available.

Regrouping along the coordinate projections of a finite dependent product turns a sum whose
summand is weighted by a sum of coordinate functions into a sum of one-coordinate sums against
the fibrewise masses; this is the algebraic core of multi-marginal linear programming.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.sum_eq_sum_image_fiber`: `∑ i, F i` is the sum, over the values `g` takes, of the sums
  of `F` over the fibres of `g`.
* `TauCeti.sum_sum_eval_mul`: summing `(∑ i, φ i (z i)) * f z` over a finite dependent product
  regroups, coordinate by coordinate, into `∑ i, ∑ a, φ i a * ∑ z with z i = a, f z`.

/-- **A finite sum is the sum over the values actually taken of the sums over their fibres.**
Summing `F` over all of `ι` is summing, over each `k` in the image of `g`, the contribution of
the indices `g` sends to `k`.

The outer index is `Finset.univ.image g` rather than all of `κ`, so no finiteness of `κ` is
needed; that is the difference from `Fintype.sum_fiberwise`. -/

/-- **Regrouping a product-indexed sum by coordinates.** Summing `f` against a weight that is a
sum of one-coordinate functions is the same as summing, for each coordinate `i` and each value
`a` there, the value `φ i a` against the mass `f` puts on the fibre `{z | z i = a}`. -/
