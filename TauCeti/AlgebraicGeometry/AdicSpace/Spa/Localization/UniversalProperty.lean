# The geometric universal property of a rational localisation

The coordinate ring `A⟨T/s⟩` of a rational subset has an *algebraic* universal property: a
continuous `φ : A → B` into a complete `B` extends across `ρ : A → A⟨T/s⟩` as soon as `φ s` is a
unit and every fraction `φ t / φ s` is power-bounded
(`TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_completion_locTopology`).
Wedhorn's Lemma 8.1 replaces those two algebraic conditions by a single *geometric* one — that
`Spa(φ)` factors through the rational subset `U = R(T/s)`. This file carries that replacement out
in two shapes: one with the unit `φ s` kept as a hypothesis, for a caller that has it in hand, and
Wedhorn's own, in which the unit is *derived* from the geometric condition.

Wedhorn's proof has three steps, and all three are discharged here:

> As `Spa(φ)` factors through `U`, we have `|φ(t)|_w ≤ |φ(s)|_w ≠ 0` for all `w ∈ Spa B` and for
> all `t ∈ T`. This implies `φ(s) ∈ B^×` by Proposition 7.52. Moreover, for all `w ∈ Spa B` we
> have `|φ(t)/φ(s)|_w ≤ 1`. This implies `φ(t)/φ(s) ∈ B⁺` by Proposition 7.52. Thus the claim
> follows from the universal property of `A → A⟨T/s⟩`.

The step `φ s ∈ B^×` is Wedhorn's Proposition 7.52(2), which is on hand for a complete Hausdorff
Huber pair as `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isUnit_iff_forall_mem_spa_notMem_supp`; the step
`|φ(t)/φ(s)|_w ≤ 1` is a division by that unit. The step from there to `φ(t)/φ(s) ∈ B⁺` is
Proposition 7.52(1), available as `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.mem_of_forall_vle_one`, which the
assembly consumes at its one use site. All three steps are therefore proved, and each asks of the
target only what a complete affinoid ring supplies.

The other half of Lemma 8.1, that `Spa ρ : Spa A⟨T/s⟩ → Spa A` factors through `U`, is already
`TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.spaComapLoc_mem_rationalSubset`; it is not repeated here.

## Main results

All four are in the `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum` namespace.

* `isUnit_of_forall_comap_mem_rationalSubset` : if every point of `Spa (B, B⁺)` pulls back into
  `R(T/s)`, the denominator becomes a unit in `B`.
* `vle_one_of_comap_mem_rationalSubset` : at a point whose pullback lies in `R(T/s)`, the
  fraction `φ t / φ s` is sub-unit.
* `existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_of_isUnit_of_forall_comap_mem_rationalSubset` : the geometric
  universal property — a continuous `φ : A → B` whose `Spa(φ)` factors through `R(T/s)` and whose
  `φ s` is a unit extends across `A → A⟨T/s⟩` in exactly one continuous way.
* `existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_of_forall_comap_mem_rationalSubset` : **Wedhorn's Lemma 8.1** —
  the same, with the unit obtained from the geometric condition by step 1.

## The hypotheses on the target

Step 1 asks `(B, B⁺)` to be a complete Hausdorff Huber pair, which is what Wedhorn's *complete
affinoid ring* is, so it is free at the generality he states. Deriving the unit from an *open*
maximal ideal of `B` instead — the route of
`TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isUnit_of_forall_not_vle_zero` — is no option for the targets §8 is
about: by `TauCeti.Huber.IsTateRing.isOpen_iff_eq_top` an ideal of a Tate ring is open exactly
when it is `⊤`, so a nonzero Tate ring has no open maximal ideal at all, and the affinoid rings
§8 works with are Tate in its principal case.

## What this file consumes

Wedhorn's Proposition 7.52(1) — that `f ∈ B⁺` as soon as `|f(x)| ≤ 1` for all `x ∈ Spa B` — is
what turns the sub-unit bound on `φ t / φ s` into membership in `B⁺`. It is supplied by
`TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.mem_of_forall_vle_one`, landed in #4552. It asks three things of the
target:

* `IsOpen (Bplus : Set B)`,
* `[IsIntegrallyClosedIn Bplus B]`,
* `[IsHuberRing B]`.

The first two, together with `B⁺ ⊆ B°`, are the three fields of
`TauCeti.Huber.IsRingOfIntegralElements Bplus`, so the assembly below asks for that one bundled
hypothesis rather than spelling them out; with `[IsHuberRing B]` they are exactly a Huber pair on
`B`, and a consumer holding a `TauCeti.Huber.Pair B` passes its `isRingOfIntegralElements`
field. `[IsHuberRing B]` is not a restriction added to make the proof go
through: Wedhorn states Lemma 8.1 for a
continuous homomorphism into a *complete affinoid ring*, and an affinoid ring is a Huber pair.

Nonarchimedean-ness of `B` is used throughout but is not assumed: with `[IsHuberRing B]` already
present, `TauCeti.Huber.IsHuberRing.toNonarchimedeanRing` derives it from `[IsTopologicalRing B]`.
The target is therefore presented the same way as the source `A` in the same signature —
`[IsTopologicalRing _]` carrying the topology and `[IsHuberRing _]` (or a pair of definition)
carrying the Huber structure.

## References

* [T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*][wedhorn_adic] (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Lemma 8.1, whose statement and
  three-step proof are quoted above, together with Propositions 7.18 and 7.52.

## Provenance

Developed here; nothing is ported. AINTLIB reaches the corresponding statement by a different
route — a height-one reduction pairing Wedhorn's Propositions 7.18 and 7.41 — which is not
followed.

/-- **The denominator becomes a unit.** If every point of `Spa (B, B⁺)` pulls back into the
rational subset `R(T/s)`, then no point of `Spa (B, B⁺)` vanishes on `φ s`, so `φ s` is a unit
by Wedhorn's Proposition 7.52(2).

This is the first step of Wedhorn's Lemma 8.1. The form of 7.52(2) it uses,
`isUnit_iff_forall_mem_spa_notMem_supp`, asks the target to be a complete Hausdorff Huber pair,
which is what Wedhorn's *complete affinoid ring* supplies. -/

/-- **The fractions are sub-unit.** At a point of `Spv B` whose pullback lies in `R(T/s)`, the
fraction `φ t / φ s` has value at most `1`.

This is the second step of Wedhorn's Lemma 8.1: the pullback condition gives `|φ t|_w ≤ |φ s|_w`,
and dividing by the unit `φ s` — which `isUnit_of_forall_comap_mem_rationalSubset` supplies —
turns that into `|φ t / φ s|_w ≤ 1`. Nothing beyond the pullback condition is used, so the unit
enters as an argument rather than being re-derived.

The pullback condition is taken at the single point `w` where it is spent, not as a hypothesis
quantified over `spa B⁺`: the proof looks at no other point, and `Bplus` then plays no part in
the statement at all, so no topology on `B` is needed either. The assembly holds the quantified
form and passes `hfac w hw`. -/

/-! ### Lemma 8.1: the geometric universal property

The assembly. `S` is an algebraic localisation of `A` away from `s` carrying the localisation
topology, so that `A⟨T/s⟩` is its separated completion, and the three `letI`s naming the
uniformity and its two companions are the ones every statement about `A⟨T/s⟩` carries. -/

/-- **The geometric universal property of `A⟨T/s⟩`, with `φ s` a unit**: a continuous
`φ : A → B` into a complete `(B, B⁺)` whose `Spa(φ)` factors through the rational subset
`R(T/s)`, and for which `φ s` is a unit, extends across the structure map `ρ : A → A⟨T/s⟩` in
exactly one continuous way.

Of the two algebraic conditions of
`TauCeti.Huber.PairOfDefinition.existsUnique_continuous_ringHom_completion_locTopology`, the
first is the hypothesis `hs`; the second is discharged from the geometric one: each fraction
`φ t / φ s` is sub-unit at every point of `Spa (B, B⁺)` by
`vle_one_of_comap_mem_rationalSubset`, hence lies in `B⁺` and so is power-bounded.

The passage from "sub-unit at every point of `Spa (B, B⁺)`" to "in `B⁺`" is Wedhorn's
Proposition 7.52(1), applied through `mem_of_forall_vle_one`; its hypotheses on the target are
openness of `B⁺`, `[IsIntegrallyClosedIn Bplus B]` and `[IsHuberRing B]`. The proof also uses
`B⁺ ⊆ B°`. Those three conditions on `B⁺` are exactly the fields of `IsRingOfIntegralElements`,
so they are carried by the single hypothesis `hB` rather than spelled out one by one.

Asking `B` to be Huber is not a restriction added here: Wedhorn states Lemma 8.1 for a continuous
homomorphism into a *complete affinoid ring*, and an affinoid ring is a Huber pair.

The unit `φ s` is a hypothesis rather than something derived, so that a caller already holding it
need not go through step 1;
`isUnit_of_forall_comap_mem_rationalSubset` is that step, and the corollary below is the two
together, which is Wedhorn's own statement.

These are properties of the pair `(B, B⁺)` alone: they mention neither `φ` nor `T` nor `s`. The
per-morphism algebraic conditions of the universal property are replaced by the single geometric
condition `hfac`, at the cost of hypotheses on the target that are checked once. -/
