# The space `Cont A` of continuous valuations

**Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces* (arXiv:1910.05934v1), Definition 7.7 and Remark 7.9.**

`Cont A` is the subspace of `Spv A` cut out by continuity. Wedhorn defines it in one line —
"the subspace of `Spv (A)` of continuous valuations" — but that line only makes sense because
continuity is a property of the *equivalence class*, not of a chosen representative. That is
what this file supplies, and it is the reason the definition is meaningful at all. Two further
results of Wedhorn's come with it: the discrete case (Remark 7.8(2)) and the pullback along a
continuous ring homomorphism (Remark 7.9).

## Why this is not automatic

A point of `Spv A` is a valuative relation, so a predicate on valuations descends to it only if
equivalent valuations agree on the predicate. For continuity as Wedhorn states it — the
quantifier running over the value group `Γ_v` — that holds, and
`Valuation.IsEquiv.isContinuous_iff` says so. Had continuity instead been asked of every
`γ` in the ambient codomain, it would **not** descend, and `Cont A` would not be well defined;
the module docstring of `TauCeti.RingTheory.Valuation.Continuous.Basic` carries the
counterexample.

So `IsContinuous` is defined here by testing the *canonical* valuation of the point, and
`isContinuous_ofValuation_iff` says the test may equally be run on any representative.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.IsContinuous` : continuity of a point of `Spv A`, in the
  attained-value sense.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.cont` : **Wedhorn's `Cont A`**, the set of continuous points, cut
  out by the attained-value test — see its docstring for how that relates to Wedhorn's
  value-group quantifier.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isContinuous_ofValuation_iff` : continuity may be tested on any
  representative, not only the canonical one — the well-definedness making `cont` meaningful.
  Membership `ofValuation w ∈ cont A` reduces to it through the `@[simp]` `mem_cont_iff`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.isContinuous_trivialSection_iff` : the trivial valuation of a
  prime is a continuous point exactly when that prime is open — **Remark 4.6**, and the
  continuity input to Proposition 7.51.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.IsContinuous.comap` : **Remark 7.9**, that a continuous ring
  homomorphism pulls continuous points back to continuous points. Combined with `mem_cont_iff`
  this is exactly the statement that `comap φ` restricts to a map `Cont B → Cont A`; no separate
  set-level lemma is kept for it, since that would be this one after unfolding.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.IsContinuous.quotientLift` : continuity descends to the canonical
  lift through a quotient.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.closure_zero_subset_supp_of_isContinuous`,
  `closure_zero_le_supp_of_isContinuous`: every continuous valuation kills the closure of zero.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.cont_eq_univ` : **Remark 7.8(2)**, `Cont A = Spv A` for discrete `A`.
* `TauCeti.ValuationSpectrum.cont_eq_empty_of_one_mem_closure_zero` : if `1` belongs to the
  closure of zero, then `Cont A` is empty.

## References

* T. Wedhorn, *Adic Spaces*, arXiv:1910.05934v1, Definition 7.7 and Remarks 7.8, 7.9; Remark
  4.6 and Proposition 7.51 for the trivial valuation of an open prime.

## Provenance

The corresponding development in AINTLIB (`github.com/CBirkbeck/AINTLIB`, Apache-2.0), branch
`dev/adic-spaces` at commit `37bbdaeb9ad9e3bc9f0d660feadc2779e455a91c`, project
`projects/AdicSpaces/`, file `Adic spaces/ContinuousValuations.lean`, was consulted rather than
copied. Its `ValuationSpectrum.IsContinuous` also tests the canonical valuation, but because its
valuation-level predicate quantifies over the ambient codomain it can only offer the one-way
`isContinuous_ofValuation_of`; the `↔` here is what makes `cont` well defined.

`isContinuous_trivialSection_iff` comes from a second file of that same project,
`Adic spaces/AdicSpectrum.lean`, section `Prop752`, which runs the argument inline for maximal
ideals on the way to Wedhorn 7.52(2). It is stated here for prime ideals as a named
characterisation, so that the downstream development can cite it instead of repeating it.

/-- **Continuity of a point of `Spv A`.** A point is *continuous* when its canonical valuation
is, in the attained-value sense of `Valuation.IsContinuous`. Any representative would do
— that is `isContinuous_ofValuation_iff` — but the canonical one makes the definition depend on
nothing chosen.

Under `[ContinuousConstSMul Aᵐᵒᵖ A]` this is Wedhorn's Definition 7.7; see `cont`. -/
def IsContinuous (v : Spv A) : Prop :=
  v.valuation.IsContinuous

/-- Continuity of a point, unfolded to its canonical valuation. -/
@[simp]
theorem isContinuous_def (v : Spv A) : v.IsContinuous ↔ v.valuation.IsContinuous :=
  Iff.rfl

/-- **Wedhorn's `Cont A`**: the continuous points of `Spv A`, as a `Set (Spv A)`. Wedhorn calls
it a subspace; here it is the underlying set, and the subspace topology is the one the *coercion*
`↥(cont A)` carries as a subtype of `Spv A`.

Membership is the attained-value test of `Valuation.IsContinuous`, which is Wedhorn's
Definition 7.7 once right multiplication is continuous —
`isContinuous_iff_forall_isOpen_lt_div` is that step, and it is where
`[ContinuousConstSMul Aᵐᵒᵖ A]` is asked for. It is *not* asked for
here: an unused instance argument is a lint violation, and every setting `Cont A` is used in — a
Huber ring, and `Spa` beyond it — is a topological ring, which supplies it at the point of use. -/

@[simp]
theorem mem_cont_iff (v : Spv A) : v ∈ cont A ↔ v.IsContinuous := Iff.rfl

/-- **Continuity may be tested on any representative.** This is what makes `cont` well defined:
the point `ofValuation w` is continuous exactly when `w` is, for every `w` in the class, not
merely for the canonical one. It rests on `Valuation.IsEquiv.isContinuous_iff`, and
would fail for a continuity predicate quantified over the ambient codomain.

Not `@[simp]`: `isContinuous_def` already rewrites the left-hand side, so this would not be in
simp-normal form. -/
theorem isContinuous_ofValuation_iff {Γ₀ : Type*} [LinearOrderedCommGroupWithZero Γ₀]
    (w : Valuation A Γ₀) : (ofValuation w).IsContinuous ↔ w.IsContinuous :=
  (isEquiv_valuation_ofValuation w).isContinuous_iff

/-- **A trivial-valuation point is continuous exactly when its prime ideal is open.** Every
value set of `trivialSection p` is `∅` (testing below a vanishing value) or `p.asIdeal` itself
(testing below a surviving value), so continuity amounts to openness of the prime; conversely
the test below `1` recovers the ideal. This is the continuity interface of the sealed
`trivialSection` — it rests on `trivialSection_vle_iff`, not on the definition's body.

This is the continuity half of **Wedhorn Remark 4.6**, and the input Proposition 7.51 needs to
exhibit an open prime as a support. The argument is AINTLIB's, from the `Prop752` section cited
in this file's Provenance, separated out here as a standalone characterisation. -/
