# Germs of sections of the sheaf of a Weil divisor

The sections of `𝒪_X(D)` over an open subset `U` are the zero rational function together with the
rational functions whose order at every codimension-one point of `U` is at least `-D`. Shrinking
`U` around a point `x` weakens that condition, and this file identifies what survives in the limit:
a rational function is a section of `𝒪_X(D)` on *some* neighbourhood of `x` exactly when it is
zero or satisfies the order bound at the codimension-one points which generize `x`.

Only finitely many codimension-one points can obstruct the bound, because a nonzero rational
function has nonzero order at finitely many of them and `D` has finite support; deleting the
closures of the obstructing points leaves an open neighbourhood of `x` on which the bound holds
at every codimension-one point.

## Main declarations

* `SchemeWeilDivisor.finite_setOf_ord_lt`: the codimension-one points at which a nonzero rational
  function violates the bound imposed by `D` are finite in number;
* `SchemeWeilDivisor.exists_map_mem_sections_of_forall_specializes` and
  `SchemeWeilDivisor.exists_map_mem_sections_iff`: the germ criterion, that a section of `𝒦_X`
  becomes a section of `𝒪_X(D)` near `x` exactly when its rational function is zero or satisfies
  the order bound at every codimension-one generization of `x`;
* `SchemeWeilDivisor.exists_map_mem_sections_iff_codimensionOne`: at a codimension-one point `x₀`
  the only codimension-one generization is `x₀` itself, so near `x₀` a section belongs to `𝒪_X(D)`
  exactly when its rational function is zero or obeys the bound from the single valuation there, and
  `SchemeWeilDivisor.exists_map_mem_sections_ord_eq`: every order allowed by that valuation is
  attained.

Together with the comparison-map results in
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/WeilDivisor/Scheme/Sheaf.lean`, the germ results show that the
comparison `𝒪_X(D) ⟶ 𝒪_X(D + x₀)` is an isomorphism on sections away from `closure {x₀}` and
compute the sections of both sheaves near `x₀`. They are the local input for the later construction
of the exact sequence `0 ⟶ 𝒪_X(D) ⟶ 𝒪_X(D + x₀) ⟶ 𝒮 ⟶ 0` with `𝒮` a skyscraper sheaf at `x₀`,
along which the Euler characteristic of a divisor sheaf is computed by induction on the divisor.

The finiteness input is
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/WeilDivisor/Scheme/Principal.lean`, the sections are
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/WeilDivisor/Scheme/Sheaf.lean`, the surjectivity of the order at a
codimension-one point with a discrete valuation ring as local ring is
`TauCeti/AlgebraicGeometry/WeilDivisor/Scheme/Order.lean`, and the topological input is Mathlib's
specialization order (`Specializes.mem_open`, `specializes_iff_mem_closure`).
