# Fibres of a map over a base

For `p : E → X`, the fibre of `p` over `x` is the set `p ⁻¹' {x}`. This file collects the two
elementary constructions on such fibres that the covering-space development uses, each stated at
the level where it is actually true: a bare function for the first, a bare equivalence for the
second.

* `Function.fiberMap`: a map `f : E → F` commuting with the projections to `X` restricts to the
  fibres over each point. It is `Set.MapsTo.restrict` for the fibre inclusion, so its application,
  identity and composition laws are the generic `Subtype.map` ones.
* `Equiv.compFiberEquiv`: relabelling the base along `h : X ≃ Y` identifies the fibre of `h ∘ p`
  over `y` with the fibre of `p` over `h.symm y`.

Together they cover the two ways the fibres of a map vary: `Function.fiberMap` moves along a map
over a fixed base and carries the identity and composition laws it inherits from `Subtype.map`,
while `Equiv.compFiberEquiv` transports fibres along a change of base and is pinned down on points
by its coercion lemmas. Neither uses a topology, so both are stated for a bare function and a bare
equivalence; a `ContinuousMap` or a `Homeomorph` is applied through its underlying function or
equivalence.

## Main declarations

* `Function.mapsTo_fiber`: a map over `X` sends each fibre into the corresponding fibre.
* `Function.fiberMap`: the restriction of a map over `X` to the fibre over `x`.
* `Equiv.compFiberEquiv`: the relabelling of fibres under an equivalence of bases.
