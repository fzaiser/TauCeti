# Finite products of Gamma distributions

This file collects what a finite product of Gamma measures looks like from the outside: the
almost-sure positivity of its coordinates, and the laws of the partial sums of those
coordinates.

The coordinatewise positivity holds for arbitrary shape and rate vectors because
`ae_pos_gammaMeasure` is parameter-independent, and every Gamma measure is sigma-finite.  For a
nonempty index type, coordinatewise positivity makes the coordinate sum positive.

Each factor is Lebesgue measure weighted by its density, so the product is Lebesgue measure on
`ι → ℝ` weighted by the product of the densities.  This is the form a change of variables on the
product needs.

At a common rate the Gamma family is closed under convolution, so the total of the coordinates
of a Gamma product is again Gamma, with the total shape.  Summing instead over the fibres of a
map `f` between finite index types leaves a Gamma product on the target type, whose shapes are
the fibre sums of the original shapes; the fibres are independent, so no correlation survives
the aggregation.  Both facts feed the normalized-Gamma construction of the Dirichlet
distribution, whose denominator is the total and whose aggregation law is the fibre-sum
statement.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ae_pos_pi_gammaMeasure` gives coordinatewise positivity in a finite Gamma product.
* `TauCeti.ae_pos_sum_pi_gammaMeasure` gives positivity of the coordinate sum for a nonempty
  finite Gamma product.
* `TauCeti.pi_gammaMeasure_eq_withDensity` presents a finite Gamma product as Lebesgue measure
  weighted by the product of the coordinate densities.
* `TauCeti.map_sum_pi_gammaMeasure` identifies the law of the total of the coordinates.
* `TauCeti.map_funOnFinite_map_pi_gammaMeasure` identifies the joint law of the fibre sums of
  the coordinates along a surjection of index types.
