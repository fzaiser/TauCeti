# Square roots of gamma variables

A positive variable whose square is gamma has a density of its own: substituting `x = t ^ 2` in
the gamma density and multiplying by the Jacobian `2 * t` turns
`r ^ a / Γ a * x ^ (a - 1) * exp (-(r * x))` into
`2 * r ^ a / Γ a * t ^ (2 * a - 1) * exp (-(r * t ^ 2))` on the positive half-line. This file
proves that correspondence in both directions: squaring carries the latter law to `gammaMeasure`,
and taking square roots carries `gammaMeasure` back.

At shape `k / 2` and rate `1 / 2` the source law is the chi law with `k` degrees of freedom, whose
density is `2 ^ (1 - k / 2) / Γ (k / 2) * t ^ (k - 1) * exp (-t ^ 2 / 2)`, and the target law is
`TauCeti.Probability.chiSquaredMeasure k`. That is the shape in which a triangular factorisation
meets a chi-squared law: the diagonal entries of a Cholesky factor carry the chi density directly,
and it is their squares that are chi-squared.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.map_sq_withDensity_eq_gammaMeasure` — squaring sends the root-gamma law to
  `gammaMeasure a r`;
* `TauCeti.map_sqrt_gammaMeasure` — the inverse correspondence, the image of `gammaMeasure a r`
  under `Real.sqrt`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.map_sq_withDensity_eq_chiSquaredMeasure` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.map_sqrt_chiSquaredMeasure` — the same pair for the chi and chi-squared
  laws;
* `TauCeti.isProbabilityMeasure_withDensity_rootGamma` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.isProbabilityMeasure_withDensity_chi` — both source laws are normalised.
