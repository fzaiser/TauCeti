# The quantile function of a real law

The *quantile function*, or generalized inverse cumulative distribution function, of a measure
`μ` on `ℝ` sends a level `t` to the least point at which `ProbabilityTheory.cdf μ` reaches `t`:

`μ.quantile t = sInf {x | t ≤ cdf μ x}`.

Because `cdf μ` is monotone and right continuous with limits `0` at `-∞` and `1` at `+∞`, that
infimum is attained for every level `t` strictly between `0` and `1`, and the defining set is
exactly the closed ray to the right of the quantile. The quantile is therefore characterized by
the Galois property `μ.quantile t ≤ x ↔ t ≤ cdf μ x`. At levels `t ≤ 0` and `1 < t` the infimum
ranges over all of `ℝ` or over the empty set, so the value there is the junk value `0`. The
endpoint level `t = 1` is not junk: the quantile there is the least point of full cumulative mass
when such a point exists (for instance `(dirac a).quantile 1 = a`), and `0` when the law has
unbounded support to the right. The inverse characterizations below use levels in `Ioo 0 1`,
which is also the interval the uniform law is taken on.

The main result is **inverse transform sampling**: for a probability measure `μ` the quantile
function pushes the uniform law on the open unit interval forward to `μ`. It presents every real
law as the law of one explicit measurable function of a single uniform variable, and it is what
makes the monotone rearrangement of two real laws a transport plan between them.

## Main definitions

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.quantile` — the generalized inverse of the cumulative distribution
  function.

## Main statements

* `MeasureTheory.Measure.quantile_le_iff` — the Galois characterization of the quantile, with
  `MeasureTheory.Measure.setOf_le_cdf_eq_Ici` its set-level form and
  `MeasureTheory.Measure.lt_quantile_iff` its negation;
* `MeasureTheory.Measure.map_quantile_volume_Ioo` — inverse transform sampling: the quantile
  function pushes the uniform law on `Ioo 0 1` forward to the original law, packaged as
  `MeasureTheory.Measure.measurePreserving_quantile`.

/-- The **quantile function** of a measure on `ℝ`: the least point at which its cumulative
distribution function reaches the level `t`.

This is the honest generalized inverse of `ProbabilityTheory.cdf μ` for `t` in `Set.Ioo 0 1`. At
levels `t ≤ 0` and `1 < t` the defining infimum ranges over all of `ℝ` or over the empty set, and
the value is the junk value `0` (`quantile_of_nonpos`, `quantile_of_one_lt`). At the endpoint
level `t = 1` the value is the least point where the cumulative distribution function reaches `1`
if there is one, and `0` otherwise. -/
