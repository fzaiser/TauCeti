# Laws of maps and source atoms

A finite-mass measurable atom of a source measure is an obstruction to a prescribed law: every
almost-everywhere measurable map sends its whole mass to a single point of a standard Borel target.
For singleton atoms this needs no condition on the target measurable space, since their image is
already explicit. This file records both forms of the constraint and their consequences for
transporting Dirac measures and for laws that are null on singletons.

## Main results

* `ProbabilityTheory.HasLaw.measure_singleton_le` — the law of `T` gives `{T x}` at least the
  mass the source gives `{x}`, with `ProbabilityTheory.HasLaw.measure_singleton_eq_zero` and
  `TauCeti.Probability.not_hasLaw_of_measure_singleton_ne_zero` its reading for a law that is
  null on singletons;
* `AEMeasurable.exists_map_restrict_eq_smul_dirac_of_atom` — the image of a finite positive
  measurable atom under an a.e.-measurable map to a standard Borel space is a point mass;
* `ProbabilityTheory.HasLaw.exists_measure_atom_le_measure_singleton` — a law receiving such an
  atom has a singleton of at least the atom's mass;
* `TauCeti.Probability.hasLaw_dirac_source_iff` — an a.e. measurable map has law `ν` under
  `Measure.dirac x` exactly when `ν` is the Dirac measure at its value at `x`;
* `TauCeti.Probability.not_hasLaw_dirac_source_of_forall_ne_dirac` — no map at all has a
  non-Dirac law under a Dirac measure.

Mathlib's `ProbabilityTheory.hasLaw_dirac_iff` is the statement for a Dirac *target*; the results
here are about a Dirac *source*, which is what `dirac_source` records in their names.

/-- **A source point mass constrains the law.** A map moves all the mass of `{x}` to the single
point `T x`, so its law weighs `{T x}` at least as much as the source weighs `{x}`. No
measurability of the singletons is needed: the bound comes from
`MeasureTheory.Measure.le_map_apply_image`, which only uses a.e. measurability of the map. -/

/-- **A nonzero source singleton has no transport onto a law that is null on singletons.** This
is the basic infeasibility of the Monge problem: no map can push such a source measure onto such
a target measure. -/

measure that is not itself a Dirac measure: a map carries its own a.e. measurability along with
the law it is claimed to have. -/
