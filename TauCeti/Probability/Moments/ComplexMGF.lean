# Analytic continuation of a moment-generating function

The moment-generating function of a real random variable `X` is the restriction to the real axis
of `ProbabilityTheory.complexMGF X μ`, which is analytic on the vertical strip over the interior
of the exponential-integrability domain.  A closed form for `mgf X μ` on a real interval therefore
determines `complexMGF X μ` on the whole strip above it, as soon as the proposed formula is itself
analytic there.  For an a.e.-measurable `X`, `complexMGF X μ` on the imaginary axis is the
characteristic function of the law of `X`, so this is the standard route from a moment-generating
function to a characteristic function.

`TauCeti.eqOn_complexMGF_of_eqOn_mgf` packages that continuation step, and
`MeasureTheory.charFun_eq_complexMGF_inner` supplies its vector-valued end point: on a type
carrying a real-valued pairing `⟪·, ·⟫`, the characteristic function at `t` is the value at
`Complex.I` of the complex moment-generating function of the statistic `x ↦ ⟪x, t⟫`.  The bulk of
the file carries the continuation out for the closed form

`mgf X μ t = ∏ j, (1 - 2 * t * lam j) ^ (-a j)`,

a product of real powers of a pencil of linear factors.  This is the shape taken by the trace
statistic of a Wishart matrix and, more generally, by any weighted sum of independent scaled
chi-squared variables with weights `lam j`.  On the imaginary axis the answer must be written as
an exponential of a *sum* of principal logarithms rather than as a single complex power of the
product: multiplying the factors before taking the logarithm can cross the branch cut.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.eqOn_complexMGF_of_eqOn_mgf`: an analytic function agreeing with `mgf X μ` on an open
  convex set of reals inside the exponential-integrability domain agrees with `complexMGF X μ` on
  the vertical strip above that set.
* `TauCeti.complexMGF_eq_exp_of_mgf_eq_prod_rpow`: the value of `complexMGF X μ` at any point of
  the strip on which the pencil `1 - 2 * z.re * lam j` is positive.
* `TauCeti.complexMGF_I_eq_exp_of_mgf_eq_prod_rpow`: its value at `Complex.I`, which for a
  measurable `X` is the characteristic function of the law of `X` at `1`.
* `MeasureTheory.charFun_eq_complexMGF_inner`: for a real-valued pairing `⟪·, ·⟫`, the
  characteristic function at `t` is the value at `Complex.I` of the complex moment-generating
  function of the statistic `x ↦ ⟪x, t⟫`.
