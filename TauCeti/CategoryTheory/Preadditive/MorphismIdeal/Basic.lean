# Two-sided ideals of a preadditive category and their quotients

A **two-sided ideal** `I` of a preadditive category `C` assigns to every pair of objects an
additive subgroup `I(X, Y)` of the hom group `X ⟶ Y`, stable under composition with arbitrary
morphisms on either side. Two parallel morphisms are congruent modulo `I` when their difference
lies in `I`; this is a congruence, and the quotient category `C/I` has the objects of `C` and the
hom groups `(X ⟶ Y) ⧸ I(X, Y)`.

Such quotients are how stable categories arise: the stable category of a Frobenius exact category
is the quotient by the ideal of morphisms factoring through a projective-injective object, and
the homotopy category of complexes is the quotient by the ideal of null-homotopic chain maps.
This file supplies the generic part of that construction, for an arbitrary ideal:

* the quotient category is preadditive, the quotient functor is additive, full and essentially
  surjective, and its hom groups are the quotient groups `(X ⟶ Y) ⧸ I(X, Y)`;
* every ideal is the kernel of its quotient functor, and conversely the morphisms an additive
  functor sends to zero form an ideal;
* an additive functor factors through `C/I` exactly when it kills `I`, and the factorization is
  additive (and linear, when the functor is);
* over an `R`-linear category every ideal is automatically stable under the scalar action, so the
  quotient is `R`-linear with an `R`-linear quotient functor.

The quotient is Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Quotient` by the congruence `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.rel`,
so its general API — uniqueness of factorizations (`CategoryTheory.Quotient.lift_unique'`),
descent of natural transformations (`CategoryTheory.Quotient.natTransLift`), and fullness and
faithfulness of precomposition with the quotient functor — applies to `C/I` unchanged.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal C`: a two-sided ideal of the preadditive category `C`, ordered by
  inclusion.
* `CategoryTheory.Functor.kerIdeal F`: the ideal of morphisms an additive functor `F` sends to
  zero.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.rel I`: congruence modulo `I`.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.Quotient I` and `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.quotientFunctor I`: the quotient
  category `C/I` and the quotient functor `C ⥤ C/I`.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.homAddEquiv I X Y`: the identification of the hom group of `C/I` with
  the quotient group `(X ⟶ Y) ⧸ I(X, Y)`.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.lift I F hF`: the factorization through `C/I` of a functor killing `I`.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.quotientFunctor_map_eq_zero_iff`: a morphism becomes zero in `C/I`
  exactly when it lies in `I`, and `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.kerIdeal_quotientFunctor` the resulting
  statement that `I` is the kernel of its quotient functor.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.exists_quotientFunctor_comp_eq_iff`: an additive functor factors through
  `C/I` exactly when its kernel contains `I`.
* `TauCeti.MorphismIdeal.smul_mem`: an ideal of an `R`-linear category is stable under scalars.
