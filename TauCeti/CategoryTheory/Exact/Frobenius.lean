# Frobenius exact categories

An exact structure has enough projectives when every object is the third term of a conflation
whose middle term is relatively projective. Dually, it has enough injectives when every object is
the first term of a conflation whose middle term is relatively injective. The projective and
injective modules record these conditions using bundled presentations; this file defines a
Frobenius exact structure by requiring both conditions and equality of the two relative object
classes.

The definition is deliberately a property of a specified `TauCeti.ExactStructure`: an additive
category can carry more than one exact structure, with different projective and injective objects.
The split exact structure is the basic example, while the abelian comparison lemmas turn Mathlib's
ordinary enough-projective and enough-injective hypotheses into presentations for the canonical
abelian exact structure.

This is the input for the stable-category construction: choosing the presentations supplies the
projective-injective middle terms used to define suspension and loop objects.
