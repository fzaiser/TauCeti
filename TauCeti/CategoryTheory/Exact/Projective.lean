# Relative projectives in an exact category, and the horseshoe lemma

Let `E` be a Quillen exact structure on an additive category `C`. An object `Q` is
*`E`-projective* when every morphism out of `Q` lifts along every deflation of `E`. This is the
relative notion Bühler uses: it depends on the exact structure, not just on the category. For
the split exact structure every object is projective, and for the canonical exact structure of
an abelian category it is Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Projective`.

Two theorems make relative projectives usable for resolutions, and both are proved by the same
method — pull a conflation back along a deflation, then split the resulting conflation because
its third term is projective — although each builds its own pullback square. **Schanuel's
lemma** says that two conflations `K ↪ Q ↠ X` and `K' ↪ Q' ↠ X` with projective middle terms
have stably isomorphic kernels, `K ⊞ Q' ≅ K' ⊞ Q`.

The main theorem is the **horseshoe lemma**. Given a conflation `X ↪ Y ↠ Z` and first steps
`K_X ↪ Q_X ↠ X` and `K_Z ↪ Q_Z ↠ Z` of resolutions of the two outer terms, with `Q_Z`
projective, there is a conflation

```text
K ↪ Q_X ⊞ Q_Z ↠ Y
```

whose middle term is the direct sum of the two resolving terms and whose kernel `K` is itself an
extension `K_X ↪ K ↠ K_Z` of the two syzygies, compatibly with the two given conflations.
Iterating it resolves the middle term of a conflation from resolutions of the outer terms, and
that is the form in which the last result of this file states it: for an object property `P`
consisting of projectives, containing a zero object and closed under binary biproducts, admitting
a finite `P`-resolution is closed under extensions, with no increase in length.

That closure property is what makes the objects of finite projective dimension an
extension-closed subcategory, so that
`TauCeti.ExactStructure.fullSubcategory` equips them with an induced exact structure — the
setting in which the resolution theorem compares their Grothendieck group with the one generated
by the projectives themselves.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.isProjective`: the object property of being projective relative to an
  exact structure, together with the lift `TauCeti.ExactStructure.isProjective.factorThru` of a
  morphism along a deflation.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.splittingOfProjective`: the splitting of a conflation whose third term
  is projective.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.ProjectivePresentation` and
  `TauCeti.ExactStructure.EnoughProjectives`: relative projective presentations and the condition
  that every object admits one.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.split_isProjective` and
  `TauCeti.ExactStructure.abelian_isProjective_iff`: the two calibrating computations. Every
  object is projective for the split exact structure, and for the canonical exact structure of
  an abelian category the notion is Mathlib's `CategoryTheory.Projective`.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.split_enoughProjectives` and
  `TauCeti.ExactStructure.abelian_enoughProjectives`: the corresponding enough-projective
  calibrations.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.nonempty_iso_biprod_of_projective`: **Schanuel's lemma**, that two
  conflations over the same object with projective middle terms have stably isomorphic kernels.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.exists_conflation_biprod_of_conflation_of_projective`: **the horseshoe
  lemma**.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.exists_finiteResolution_length_le_of_conflation`: the middle term of a
  conflation admits a finite `P`-resolution of length at most the common bound on the lengths of
  resolutions of the two outer terms, when `P` consists of projectives, contains a zero object
  and is closed under binary biproducts.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.isExtensionClosed_admitsFiniteResolution`: under those same hypotheses
  on `P`, admitting a finite `P`-resolution is closed under extensions.
* `TauCeti.ExactStructure.isExtensionClosed_of_le_isProjective` and
  `TauCeti.ExactStructure.fullSubcategory_eq_split`: a property consisting of projectives is
  itself extension closed, and the exact structure it inherits is the split one.

## Implementation notes

The horseshoe is proved without ever choosing a lift of `Q_Z` into `Y` by hand. Pulling the
conflation `X ↪ Y ↠ Z` back along the deflation `Q_Z ↠ Z` gives a conflation `X ↪ W ↠ Q_Z`,
which splits because `Q_Z` is projective, while pulling the conflation `K_Z ↪ Q_Z ↠ Z` back
along `Y ↠ Z` exhibits the *same* object `W` as an extension of `Y` by `K_Z`. Composing the
resulting deflation `W ↠ Y` with the direct sum `Q_X ⊞ Q_Z ↠ X ⊞ Q_Z ≅ W` and applying the dual
Noether package `TauCeti.ExactStructure.exists_conflation_comp'` produces the conflation and
identifies its kernel in one step.

section Horseshoe

/-- **The horseshoe lemma.** Let `S : X ↪ Y ↠ Z` be a conflation and let
`K_X ↪ Q_X ↠ X` and `K_Z ↪ Q_Z ↠ Z` be conflations resolving its two outer terms, with `Q_Z`
projective. Then `Y` is the third term of a conflation whose middle term is `Q_X ⊞ Q_Z` and
whose first term is an extension of `K_Z` by `K_X`.

The two conflations form a horseshoe over the given one: the new deflation `a` restricts on the
first summand to `Q_X ↠ X ↪ Y` and covers `Q_Z ↠ Z` on the second, while the new inflation `u`
restricts on `K_X` to `K_X ↪ Q_X ↪ Q_X ⊞ Q_Z` and covers `K_Z ↪ Q_Z` on the second summand.

Iterating this is what lifts resolutions of `X` and of `Z` to a resolution of `Y`; see

This is the horseshoe lemma, iterated: at each stage the two resolving terms are added, and the
new syzygy is an extension of the two old ones. -/

/-- **The objects of finite `P`-dimension are extension closed**, for an object property `P`
consisting of `E`-projectives which contains a zero object and is closed under binary
biproducts. The middle term of a conflation is covered by
`TauCeti.ExactStructure.IsExtensionClosed.prop_X₂`.

Together with `TauCeti.ExactStructure.fullSubcategory` this equips them with an induced exact
structure, in which the resolution theorem compares their Grothendieck group with the one
generated by the objects satisfying `P`. -/
