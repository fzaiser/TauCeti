# Linear and additive codes

This file fixes the carrier conventions for finite-coordinate codes. A linear code over a field
is a submodule of the word space, while an additive code over a commutative additive group is an
additive subgroup. Consequently, the lattice operations, maps, comaps, and membership notation
are exactly those of `Submodule` and `AddSubgroup` rather than parallel wrappers.

These aliases let matrix presentations, Hamming invariants, and duality share Mathlib's existing
subobject APIs. Coordinate types are arbitrary; results about dimensions or matrices add
finiteness assumptions where needed, and particular codes may use `Fin n` to display a
conventional matrix.

`ι → F`. -/
abbrev LinearCode (F ι : Type*) [Field F] := Submodule F (ι → F)

/-- An additive code over `A` with coordinate set `ι` is an additive subgroup of the word space
`ι → A`. No scalar closure is implicit in this notion. -/
