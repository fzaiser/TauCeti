# Worked examples: the de Finetti public API

This file demonstrates the public de Finetti API available from the single facade import
`TauCeti.Probability.DeFinetti`. The initial bare references give a compact index of the principal
process predicates, implications, representation theorems, uniqueness results, and empirical
convergence statements.

The worked examples then use two complementary descriptions of an exchangeable law. The canonical
mixing-law example shows that an i.i.d. path law has a Dirac de Finetti measure. The two affine
examples show that a convex combination of two Dirac mixing laws corresponds exactly to the same
convex combination of the associated i.i.d. path laws, in both directions. Together they
illustrate how the representation theorem and its affine equivalence are used in concrete
calculations.

Further worked examples live with the objects they concern: the conditionally i.i.d. coin-flip
construction in `Exchangeability/ConditionallyIID/CoinFlips.lean`, the constant-witness
characterisation of i.i.d. in `ConditionallyIID/Const.lean`, and the stationary but
non-exchangeable 3-cycle in `Exchangeability/ThreeCycle.lean`.

The canonical mixing-law example rests on the uniqueness statement
`eq_deFinettiMeasure_of_pathLaw_eq_bind_infinitePi` together with the barycentre computation
`deFinettiBarycenter_dirac`; the affine examples rest on `deFinettiEquiv` and its values on Dirac
mixing laws and on convex combinations, in both directions. A reader adapting these calculations to
another exchangeable law should start from those results.
