# Linear growth of partial sums from a window bound

If nonnegative terms `f n` have sums over the multiplicative windows `q x < n ≤ x` bounded by a
multiple of `x`, for a fixed ratio `0 ≤ q < 1` and all large `x`, then their partial sums
`∑_{1 ≤ n ≤ x} f n` are `O(x)`: the partial sum up to `x` is the window sum plus the partial sum
up to `q x`, and the window bounds form a geometric series.

This is the summation step of Chebyshev-type bounds, where a local estimate on windows
`(q x, x]` comes from a smoothed average and the global linear bound is what is needed.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.isBigO_sum_Icc_of_sum_Ioc_floor_mul_le`: a window bound `O(x)` implies partial sums
  `O(x)`.

/-- **Summing windows.** If nonnegative terms `f n` have sums over the windows `q x < n ≤ x`
bounded by `K x` for all large `x`, where `0 ≤ q < 1` is a fixed ratio, then their partial sums
`∑_{1 ≤ n ≤ x} f n` are `O(x)`. -/
