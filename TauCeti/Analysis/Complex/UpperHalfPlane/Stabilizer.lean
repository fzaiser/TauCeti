# Point stabilizers of subgroups of `PSL(2, ℝ)`

The transformations fixing a point `z` of the upper half-plane are recorded by their derivative
there. By the chain rule that derivative is multiplicative on the stabilizer, so it is a
character `stabilizer Γ z →* ℂ` for any subgroup `Γ ≤ PSL(2, ℝ)`, and it is injective: a Möbius
transformation fixing `z` with derivative `1` there is the identity. Hence a point stabilizer is
commutative, and cyclic as soon as it is finite — a finite subgroup of the multiplicative monoid
of a field is cyclic.

The injectivity of the character turns the order of a generator into the order of its
derivative, so the derivative of a generator of a finite point stabilizer is a primitive root of
unity whose order is the order of the stabilizer. Finally, every nontrivial element of a point
stabilizer is an elliptic matrix.

The specialization to discrete subgroups, whose point stabilizers are finite, is
`TauCeti.Analysis.Complex.Fuchsian.Stabilizer`.

## Main declarations

* `Subgroup.stabilizerDeriv`: the derivative character of a point stabilizer, and
  `Subgroup.stabilizerDeriv_injective`.
* `Subgroup.isCyclic_stabilizer`: a finite point stabilizer is cyclic.
* `Subgroup.exists_isPrimitiveRoot_stabilizerDeriv`: a generator of a finite point
  stabilizer has a primitive root of unity of the stabilizer's order as its derivative.
* `Matrix.SpecialLinearGroup.isElliptic_of_smul_eq_self_of_ne_one`: a matrix fixing a point of
  `ℍ` and nontrivial in `PSL(2, ℝ)` is elliptic.
