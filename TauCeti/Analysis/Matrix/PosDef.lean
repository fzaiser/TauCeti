# The positive-definite cone in the space of all square matrices

Positivity of `x ⬝ᵥ M *ᵥ x` on nonzero vectors cuts out an open set of real square matrices,
symmetric or not.

The positive-definite cone itself is not open in the space of all square matrices — the
Hermitian condition cuts out a proper subspace once there are at least two rows — but on the
symmetric subspace, where the Hermitian condition holds identically, the cone is the preimage
of this open set and hence open; see `TauCeti.MeasureTheory.Measure.SymmetricMatrix.PosDef`.
Ambiently the cone is still measurable, being the intersection of the closed Hermitian condition
with that open one.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.isOpen_setOfPred_dotProduct_mulVec_pos` — positivity of the quadratic form on nonzero
  vectors is an open condition on real square matrices;
* `TauCeti.measurableSet_setOfPred_posDef` — the positive-definite matrices form a measurable
  set.
