# A possible singularity on the contour: the half-residue on a half-disc boundary

The pure on-contour case of `WorkedExamples/HalfDisc/Poles.lean`: an integrand whose only possible
singularity is at the origin, where it is at worst a simple pole and where the half-disc contour
passes straight through. Nothing is enclosed, so the result is the **half-residue** identity: the
origin's generalized winding number is `½` (`windingNumber_halfDiscBoundary`), and its contribution
is `π i · Res`. When the singularity is a genuine simple pole, rather than removable or regular,
this is half the `2π i · Res` contribution of an enclosed pole and is Hungerbühler–Wasem's
motivating example.

Each statement here is the `S = ∅` case of its counterpart in `HalfDisc/Poles.lean`, restated
without the (then empty) sum over enclosed poles because that is the shape the Dirichlet-integral
evaluation downstream consumes.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.Contour.hasCauchyPV_halfDiscBoundary_of_simple_pole` — for any `f` holomorphic off
  the origin with at worst a simple pole there, the principal value of `∫_γ f` along the
  half-disc boundary is `π i · residue f 0`.
* `TauCeti.Contour.hasCauchyPV_halfDiscBoundary_inv` — the concrete instance `f z = z⁻¹`, whose
  principal value is exactly `π i`.
* `TauCeti.Contour.hasCauchyPV_halfDiscBoundary_diameter` — the same identity with the arc
  contribution subtracted off, leaving the principal value along the diameter and an explicit
  `circleMap` integral for the arc, the form Jordan's lemma bounds.
* `TauCeti.Contour.hasCauchyPV_realSegment_diameter` — the same, restated along the straight line
  `t ↦ t`, which is the form a real-axis improper integral consumes.

/-- **The half-residue theorem on the half-disc boundary.** If `f` is holomorphic off the origin
and has at worst a simple pole there (the hypotheses also permit a removable singularity, or
`f` holomorphic at `0`, in which case the residue is `0`), then along the half-disc boundary —
which passes *through* the origin — the Cauchy principal value of `∫ f` is `π i · residue f 0`:
half of what the classical residue theorem would give for a pole enclosed by the contour, because
the generalized winding number at a smooth crossing is `½`.

This is `hasCauchyPV_halfDiscBoundary_of_simple_poles` with no enclosed poles. -/

/-- **The motivating example**: the principal value of `∫ dz / z` along the half-disc
boundary is `π i`. The pole sits *on* the contour, so the classical residue theorem does not
apply and the integral exists only as a principal value; the generalized theorem evaluates it as
half the enclosed-pole answer `2π i`. -/

/-- **Splitting the half-disc: the diameter piece.** Subtracting the arc contribution from the
half-residue identity leaves the principal value along the diameter alone.

The arc term is expressed as a `circleMap` integral, which is the form Jordan's lemma bounds. It
vanishes as `R → ∞` for an integrand `e^{iaz} · g z` (`a > 0`) whose sup bound on the semicircle
tends to `0` — oscillation alone is not enough, the amplitude must decay. The concrete case
`f z = e^{iz}/z`, where that bound is `1/R`, is the Hungerbühler–Wasem motivating example.

This is `hasCauchyPV_halfDiscBoundary_diameter_of_simple_poles` with no enclosed poles. -/

/-- **The identity along the real segment.** The diameter of the half-disc traces the straight
line `t ↦ t`, so the principal value can be stated along that curve directly — the form the
real-axis improper integral consumes, with no reference to the auxiliary contour.
