# Smoothing a finite-difference completely monotone function

`TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone.isCompletelyMonotone` upgrades the finite-difference sign
condition to genuine complete monotonicity, but only for a function that is already `C^∞`. This
file supplies the missing smoothing step without imposing any regularity beyond the difference
condition itself.

Averaging `f` against a smooth probability density supported in `(-ε, 0)`,
`g t = ∫ ψ s · f (t - s) ds`,
only ever evaluates `f` on `[t, t + ε]`, so on `[0, ∞)` it never leaves the half-line where the
hypothesis lives. The average is `C^∞` because it is a convolution with a smooth compactly
supported kernel, and every mixed forward difference of `g` is the same average of the
corresponding difference of `f`, so the sign condition passes to `g` verbatim. Since `f` is
nonincreasing, `g` is squeezed between `f (· + ε)` and `f`, by the general kernel-average bound
`TauCeti.MeasureTheory.integral_kernel_mem_Icc_of_antitoneOn`.

The outcome,
`TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone.exists_isCompletelyMonotone_between_shift`, is a completely
monotone `g` with `f (t + ε) ≤ g t ≤ f t` on `[0, ∞)`.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.IsDifferenceCompletelyMonotone.exists_isCompletelyMonotone_between_shift`: a function
  that is completely monotone in the finite-difference sense is squeezed between the shift
  `f (· + ε)` and `f` by a completely monotone function, for every `ε > 0`.

/-- **Smoothing a finite-difference completely monotone function.** If all mixed forward
differences of `f` with nonnegative steps alternate in sign on `[0, ∞)`, then for every `ε > 0`
there is a genuinely completely monotone `g` with
`f (t + ε) ≤ g t ≤ f t` for `t ≥ 0`.

The function `g` is the average of `f` against a smooth probability density supported in
`(-ε, 0)`; smoothness comes from the convolution, the sign condition is inherited pointwise, and
the two-sided bound is monotonicity of `f`. -/
