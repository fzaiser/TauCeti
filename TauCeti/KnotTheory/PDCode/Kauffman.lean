# The Kauffman bracket of a PD-code

Smoothing every crossing of a diagram in one of its two ways turns the diagram into a disjoint
union of circles. A **state** of a PD-code with `n` crossings is such a choice at each crossing,
recorded as `s : Fin n → Bool`, with `s i = true` selecting the `A`-smoothing at crossing `i`:
the smoothing that turns left off the over-strand, equivalently the one joining the two regions
swept out when the over-strand is rotated counterclockwise. With the four slots of a crossing in
counterclockwise order that smoothing takes each over-slot to the preceding slot, which is
`TauCeti.PDCode.slotSmoothing` applied to the code's own over-pair indicator; the `B`-smoothing
is the same construction applied to the complementary indicator.

Reconnecting the half-edges accordingly gives `TauCeti.PDCode.statePerm`, the traversal of the
smoothed diagram: cross an arc, then follow the smoothing at the crossing reached. Exactly as for
`TauCeti.PDCode.componentPerm`, each circle of the smoothed diagram carries two of its orbits, one
for each direction of travel, so `TauCeti.PDCode.stateLoopCount` halves the orbit count and adds
the crossing-free circles that the code records separately.

The **Kauffman bracket** is the resulting state sum `∑ s, a ^ (A(s) - B(s)) * δ ^ (loops s - 1)`,
formed
over a commutative ring with a distinguished unit `a` at the loop value
`δ = -(a ^ 2 + a⁻¹ ^ 2)` (`TauCeti.TemperleyLieb.jonesDelta`), which is the value at which the
Kauffman-bracket expansion of a crossing is invertible. This is Kauffman's `⟨·⟩` with Lickorish's
normalisation `⟨unknot⟩ = 1`: a code with no crossings and `c ≥ 1` circles has bracket
`δ ^ (c - 1)`. The exponent is truncated subtraction, so the empty code has bracket `1`; every
code with a crossing has at least one circle in each state, so this affects only the empty code.

The bracket depends on a PD-code only through its relabelling class, and mirroring a code inverts
the unit `a`. On the one-crossing kink diagram `TauCeti.PDCode.kink` it takes the value
`-a ^ 3`, the framing factor of the first Reidemeister move. Whether the bracket descends from
diagrams to knots is the question of its behaviour under the Reidemeister moves, which are a
separate construction on PD-codes and are not treated here.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.PDCode.slotSmoothing`: the two smoothings of the four slots at a crossing.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.smoothingTurn`: the reconnection of the half-edges smoothing every crossing.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.smoothingChoice`: the over-pair indicator a state selects at each crossing.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.statePerm`: the traversal of the smoothed diagram.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.stateLoopCount`: the number of circles of the smoothed diagram.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.stateWeight`: the weight `a ^ (A(s) - B(s))` of a state.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket`: the Kauffman bracket state sum.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kink`: the one-crossing kink diagram.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket_relabel`: the bracket is invariant under relabelling.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket_mirror`: mirroring the code inverts the unit.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket_eq_jonesDelta_pow`: a code with no crossings and `c` circles has
  bracket `δ ^ (c - 1)`.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.stateLoopCount_kink_true`, `TauCeti.PDCode.stateLoopCount_kink_false`: the two
  smoothings of a kink leave two circles and one circle.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.kauffmanBracket_kink`: the kink diagram has bracket `-a ^ 3`.
* `TauCeti.PDCode.crossingComponentCount_kink`: the kink has one component, so it is a diagram of
  a knot.

/-- **The Kauffman bracket of the kink is `-a ^ 3`**, that is, `-a ^ 3` times that of the unknot.
The two smoothings of the single crossing contribute `a * δ` and `a⁻¹`, and the loop value
collapses their sum to `-a ^ 3`: this is the framing factor by which the bracket fails to be
invariant under the first Reidemeister move. -/
