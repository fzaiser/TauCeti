# An explicit basis for small-grid homology

The fully blocked differential vanishes on grids of size at most two. Consequently every grid
state gives a cycle, no nonzero cycle is a boundary, and the corresponding homology classes form
a basis. This file makes those generators explicit.

For a grid diagram `G` of size `n ≤ 2`, `fullyBlockedCycleOfLeTwo G hn x` is the cycle represented
by the single grid state `x`, and `fullyBlockedHomologyClassOfLeTwo G hn x` is its homology class.
The basis `fullyBlockedHomologyBasisOfLeTwo G hn` consists of exactly these classes. Its
coordinate formula identifies the coefficient of a class at `x` with the coefficient of any
cycle representative at `x`.

At size two, the basis has the two states `GridState.twoByTwoId` and
`GridState.twoByTwoSwap`. For the standard two-by-two unknot diagram their already-computed
`(M_O, A)` bigradings are `(-1, -1)` and `(0, 0)`, respectively
(`maslovOℤ_twoByTwo_twoByTwoId`, `alexander_twoByTwo_twoByTwoId`,
`maslovOℤ_twoByTwo_twoByTwoSwap`, and `alexander_twoByTwo_twoByTwoSwap`). Thus the basis here
turns the separate dimension and grading calculations into an explicit computation of the
fully blocked homology.

## Main definitions

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedCycleOfLeTwo`: the cycle supported on one grid state.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedHomologyClassOfLeTwo`: its homology class.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedHomologyBasisOfLeTwo`: the basis of small-grid homology
  indexed by grid states.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedHomologyBasisOfLeTwo_apply`: every basis vector is the
  homology class of its indexing state.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedHomologyBasisOfLeTwo_repr_mk`: the coordinates of a
  homology class are the coefficients of any cycle representative.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedHomologyBasisOfLeTwo_repr_class`: a single-state class has
  the corresponding singleton coordinate vector.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedHomologyClassOfLeTwo_ne_zero` and
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedHomologyClassOfLeTwo_injective`: the state classes are
  nonzero and pairwise distinct.
