# Symmetries of the fully blocked grid complex act on cycles and boundaries

`DifferentialSymmetry.lean` shows that the diagonal reflection and the `O`/`X` marking swap of
a grid diagram are chain symmetries of the fully blocked grid complex: the marking swap fixes
the differential outright, while the reflection intertwines the differentials of `G` and
`G.transpose` through the chain relabeling `GridChain.transposeEquiv`. This file records the
immediate consequence one level up, on the kernel and range submodules from `BasicCycles.lean`:
a chain symmetry carries cycles to cycles and boundaries to boundaries.

Because these are equalities of submodules under a linear automorphism, they package as linear
equivalences between the cycle (resp. boundary) submodules of a diagram and its reflected or
marking-swapped counterpart. These chain-level symmetry equivalences need no square-zero input.

## Main results

* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedCycles_transpose`,
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedBoundaries_transpose`: the transpose chain relabeling maps
  the cycles (resp. boundaries) of `G` onto those of `G.transpose`.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedCycles_swapMarkings`,
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedBoundaries_swapMarkings`: swapping the `O` and `X` markings
  leaves the cycle and boundary submodules unchanged.
* `LinearEquiv.map_ker_of_intertwine`: the reusable kernel transport lemma used by the
  cycle-symmetry equivalences.
* `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedCyclesTransposeEquiv`,
  `TauCeti.GridDiagram.fullyBlockedBoundariesTransposeEquiv`: the same statements packaged as
  linear equivalences of submodules, each characterized on elements by an `_apply` lemma
  recording that it acts by the underlying chain relabeling.
