# Finite atom decompositions in a complemented modular lattice

In a bounded modular lattice that is complemented and satisfies the descending chain condition,
every element is the supremum of a finite independent family of atoms: split off an atom `a` of
the element `x`, meet a complement of `a` with `x`, which the modular law makes a complement of
`a` inside `x`, and recurse on that strictly smaller element.

Mathlib proves the corresponding statement for a *complete* lattice, where complementedness gives
atomisticity and the decomposition is an arbitrary supremum
(`exists_sSupIndep_of_sSup_atoms`, made finite by `WellFoundedGT.finite_of_sSupIndep`). The
descending chain condition makes the family finite from the start, which is what lattices without
arbitrary suprema — lattices of subobjects closed under finite meets and joins only — need.

## Main declarations

* `TauCeti.exists_finset_isAtom_sup_eq`: in a complemented modular lattice satisfying the
  descending chain condition, every element is the supremum of a finite independent family of

/-- **Finite atom decomposition.** In a bounded modular lattice which is complemented and
satisfies the descending chain condition, every element is the supremum of a finite family of
atoms, pairwise independent. This is semisimplicity for a lattice of subobjects: `x` is the direct
sum of finitely many simple subobjects. -/
