"""Where is the pull-request pipeline slow right now, and why?

Merge throughput is one number at the end of a queue, so a fall in it says
something is wrong without saying what. This measures each stage separately:
how fast pull requests arrive at it, how fast they leave, how deep it currently
is, and how long they sit in it, each against a trailing baseline.

Historical rates describe lifecycle-label transitions. Current depths are checked
against the pinned merge gate; label disagreements and unknown reads are explicit.
Queue membership and reservations are reported separately. The stages include:

  awaiting-CI          waiting for a build on the latest commit
  awaiting-review      green, waiting for a reviewer
  review-in-progress   a review is running on this commit
  ci-failed            build failed; the author has to act
  awaiting-author      changes requested; the author has to act
  ready-to-merge       all per-PR merge prerequisites pass
  needs-human-review   approved changes require human review
  awaiting-dependency  waiting for a stacked base
  on-hold              a draft or explicit hold

Two of those are not the project's to fix. `ci-failed` and `awaiting-author`
sit with the contributor, and reading a backlog there as a project problem
would point effort at exactly the wrong place, so they are reported separately
from the stages the project owns.

Historical data comes from the statistics snapshot. Live reports also audit open
PRs and read the queue once; --data replays the stored evidence offline:

    scripts/pipeline_health.py                       # fetch and report
    scripts/pipeline_health.py --json                # machine-readable
    scripts/pr_stats_graphs.py --dump-data snap.json --out-dir /tmp/x
    scripts/pipeline_health.py --data snap.json      # replay, no network
