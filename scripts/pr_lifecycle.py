"""What the pull-request lifecycle labels mean, in one place.

Both the statistics charts and the pipeline-health report ask questions of the
same label timelines, and the answers have to agree. They very nearly did not:
the two disagreed by nineteen hours on how long one pull request had been
waiting, because one of them treated a `ci-failed` to `awaiting-author` swap as
the start of a fresh wait and the other did not.

The rules that matter, and that no caller should have to reimplement:

* `ci-failed` and `awaiting-author` are one state for timing purposes. The author
  reads a build log for one and review threads for the other, but the ball is in
  their court either way, so swapping one for the other continues the spell
  rather than beginning a new one.
* `awaiting-review` and `review-in-progress` are likewise one state. The pipeline
  swaps them while a round is judged and can restore the first afterwards, so
  counting label applications would split one cycle into several.
* Anything else ends a spell. A push that sends a pull request back to
  `awaiting-CI` is a genuinely fresh wait even if it fails again immediately.
