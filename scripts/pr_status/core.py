"""GitHub-reading helpers and build/review signals for PR status consumers.

Zulip renders derive() as build and review reactions. Merge eligibility is stricter:
labels and pipeline health call readiness.py, which uses the pinned Auto-merge gate.
These summary helpers must not be used to infer that a PR can enter the queue.

Destructive housekeeping separately uses repo_associated_scoreboard_meta, which

    `--include` and stripping a header block from every page of a paginated read,
